An array of physical, chemical and biological methods have been used to synthesize nanomaterials. In order
to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles of particular shape and size specific methodologies have been
formulated. Although ultraviolet irradiation, aerosol technologies, lithography, laser ablation, ultrasonic
fields, and photochemical reduction techniques have been used successfully to produce nanoparticles, they
remain expensive and involve the use of hazardous chemicals. Therefore, there is a growing concern to
develop environment-friendly and sustainable methods. Since the synthesis of nanoparticles of different
compositions, sizes, shapes and controlled dispersity is an important aspect of nanotechnology new costeffective
procedures are being developed. Microbial synthesis of nanoparticles is a green chemistry approach
that interconnects nanotechnology and microbial biotechnology. Biosynthesis of gold, silver, gold–silver
alloy, selenium, tellurium, platinum, palladium, silica, titania, zirconia, quantum dots, magnetite and uraninite
nanoparticles by bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, yeasts and viruses have been reported. However, despite
the stability, biological nanoparticles are not monodispersed and the rate of synthesis is slow. To overcome
these problems, several factors such as microbial cultivation methods and the extraction techniques have to
be optimized and the combinatorial approach such as photobiological methods may be used. Cellular,
biochemical and molecular mechanisms that mediate the synthesis of biological nanoparticles should be
studied in detail to increase the rate of synthesis and improve properties of nanoparticles. Owing to the rich
biodiversity of microbes, their potential as biological materials for nanoparticle synthesis is yet to be fully
explored. In this review, we present the current status of microbial synthesis and applications of metal
nanoparticles.

1. Introduction
In recent years, nanotechnology research is emerging as cuttingedge
technology interdisciplinary with physics, chemistry, biology,
material science and medicine. The prefix nano is derived from Greek

word nanos meaning “dwarf” in Greek that refers to things of onebillionth
(109 m) in size. The primary concept of nanotechnology was
presented by Richard Feynman in a lecture entitled “There's plenty of
room at the bottom” at the American Institute of Technology in 1959.
Nanoparticles are usually 0.1 to 1000 nm in each spatial dimension
and are commonly synthesized using two strategies: top-down and
bottom-up [1]. In top-down approach, the bulk materials are
gradually broken down to nanosized materials whereas in bottomup
approach, atoms or molecules are assembled to molecular
structures in nanometer range. Bottom-up approach is commonly
used for chemical and biological synthesis of nanoparticles.
Unlike bulk materials, nanoparticles have characteristic physical,
chemical, electronic, electrical, mechanical, magnetic, thermal, dielectric,
optical and biological properties [2,3]. Decreasing the dimension of
nanoparticles has pronounced effect on the physical properties that
significantly differ from the bulk material. These physical properties are
caused by their large surface atom, large surface energy, spatial
confinement and reduced imperfections. Nanoparticles have advantages
over bulk materials due to their surface plasmon resonance (SPR),
enhanced Rayleigh scattering and surface enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) in metal nanoparticles, quantum size effect in semiconductors
and supermagnetism in magnetic materials. Therefore, nanoparticles
are considered as building blocks of the next generation of optoelectronics,
electronics, and various chemical and biochemical sensors [4,5].
Optoelectronic, physicochemical and electronic properties of nanoparticles
are determined by their size, shape and crystallinity. Therefore,
the synthesis of monodispersed nanoparticles with different size and
shape has been a challenge in nanotechnology. Although various
physical and chemical methods are extensively used to produce monodispersed
nanoparticles, the stability and the use of toxic chemicals is
the subject of paramount concern. The use of toxic chemicals on the
surface of nanoparticles and non-polar solvents in the synthesis
procedure limits their applications in clinical fields. Therefore, development
of clean, biocompatible, non-toxic and eco-friendly methods for
nanoparticles synthesis deserves merit. Although biological methods
are regarded as safe, cost-effective, sustainable and environmentfriendly
processes, they also have some drawbacks in culturing of
microbes, which is time-consuming and difficult in providing better
control over size distribution, shape and crystallinity. The biological
nanoparticles are also not monodispersible and the rate of production is
slow. These are the problems that have plagued the biological synthesis
approaches, but the insights gained from strain selection, optimizing the
conditions such pH, incubation temperature and time, concentration of
metal ions, and the amount of biological material has come up to give
hope in implementation of these approaches in large scale and for
commercial applications. There are also the possibilities of producing
genetically engineered microbes that overexpress specific reducing
agents and thereby, controlling the size and shape of biological
nanoparticles. The combinatorial approach such as photobiological
methods as proved in the case of Fusarium oxysporum-mediated silver
nanoparticles production [6] will help to increase the rate of production.
While exploring the natural secrets for the synthesis of nanoparticles
by microbes, which are regarded as potent eco-friendly green
nanofactories, scientists have discovered magnetite particles by magnetotactic
bacteria [7,8], siliceous materials by diatoms [9], and gypsum
and calcium layers by S-layer bacteria [10]. Interactions between metals
and microbes have been exploited for various biological applications in
the fields of bioremediation, biomineralization, bioleaching, and
biocorrosion [11] and the microbial synthesis of nanoparticles has
been emerged as a promising field of research as nanobiotechnology
interconnecting biotechnology and nanotechnology.
2. Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by bacteria
Microbes produce inorganic materials either intra- or extracellularly
often in nanoscale dimensions with exquisite morphology. Microbial
resistance to most toxic heavy metals is due to their chemical detoxi-
fication as well as due to energy-dependent ion efflux from the cell by
membrane proteins that function either as ATPase or as chemiosmotic
cation or proton anti-transporters. Alteration in solubility also plays a
role in microbial resistance [12,13]. Therefore, microbial systems can
detoxify the metal ions by either reduction and/or precipitation of
soluble toxic inorganic ions to insoluble non-toxic metal nanoclusters.
Microbial detoxification can be made either by extracellular biomineralization,
biosorption, complexation or precipitation or intracellular
bioaccumulation. Extracellular production of metal nanoparticles has
more commercial applications in various fields. Since the polydispersity
is the major concern, it is important to optimize the conditions for
monodispersity in a biological process [14]. In case of intracellular
production, the accumulated particles are of particular dimension and
with less polydispersity.
2.1. Intracellular synthesis of nanoparticles by bacteria
In order to release the intracellularly synthesized nanoparticles,
additional processing steps such as ultrasound treatment or reaction
with suitable detergents are required. This can be exploited in the
recovery of precious metals from mine wastes and metal leachates. Biomatrixed
metal nanoparticles could also be used as catalysts in various
chemical reactions [15]. This will help to retain the nanoparticles for
continuous usage in bioreactors. For some years now, bacterial activity has
been implicated in deposition of mineral ores. Pedomicrobium-like
budding bacteria in the Alaskar placer, reported in iron and manganese
oxide deposition process has now been found to accumulate gold [16].
Bacillus subtilis 168 reduced water soluble Au+3 ions to Au0 producing
octahedral morphology inside the cell walls in the dimensions of 5–25 nm
[17,18]. Interestingly, heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB)
enrichment from a gold mine was used to destabilize gold(I)-thiosulfate
complex (Au(S2O3)2
3−) to elemental gold (b10 nm) in the bacterial
envelope releasing H2S as end product of metabolism [19]. In Fe(III)
reducing bacterium, Geobacter ferrireducens, gold was precipitated
intracellularly in periplasmic space [20]. Similarly, in anaerobic conditions,
in the presence of hydrogen gas, iron(III)-reducing mesophilic bacterial
resting cells, Shewanella algae reduced Au+3 ions at 25 °C with 10–20 nm
in periplasmic space (pH 7.0) and with 15–200 nm on bacterial surfaces
(pH 2.8) [21]. As in the case of Gram-negative bacteria that produce
membrane vesicles like outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides
and phospholipids to protect itself against toxic chemicals, Plectonema
boryanum UTEX485, a filamentous cyanobacterium precipitates gold
nanoparticles in abiotic and cyanobacterial systems between 25 °C and
200 °C with aqueous Au(S2O3)2
−3 and AuCl4
− solution [22,23]. The
interaction of P. boryanum UTEX485 with Au(S2O3)2
−3 promoted the
accumulation in membrane vesicles with 10–25 nm in size in cubic
morphology, clustering inside the cell with b10 nm and precipitated in
solution with ∼10–25 nm along with admixed AuS nanoparticles of
b10 nm. But in the presence of AuCl4
− precipitation was resulted in
octahedral gold platelets of 1–10 μm in solution and b10 nm inside the
bacterial cells [22,23]. Escherichia coli DH5α mediated bioreduction of
chloroauric acid to Au0 nanoparticles has been reported recently [24]. The
accumulated particles on the cell surface were mostly spherical with little
other morphologies of triangles and quasi-hexagons. These cell-bound
nanoparticles have been reported for promising applications in realizing
the direct electrochemistry of hemoglobin and other proteins [24].
Similarly, the bioreduction of trivalent aurum was also reported in
photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, which showed biosorption
capacity of 92.43 mg HAuCl4/g dry weight in the logarithmic
phase of its growth. The carotenoids and NADPH-dependent enzymes
embedded in plasma membrane and/or secreted extracellularly were
found to be involved in the biosorption and bioreduction of Au+3 to Au0
on the plasma membrane and also extracellularly [25].
Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles have been exploited.
Silver-based single crystals such as equilateral, triangles and hexagons

with particle sizes upto 200 nm in periplasmic space of the bacterium
were produced by Pseudomonas stutzeri AG259, a silver mine bacterium
(Fig. 1). This bacterium also produced a small number of monoclinic
crystalline α-form silver sulfide acanthite (Ag2S) crystallite particles
with the composition of silver and sulfur in the ratio 2:1 [26,27].
Biosorption and bioreduction of Ag(I) on cell surface was also reported
in Lactobacillus sp. A09 at 30 °C, pH 4.5 in 24 h [28]. Similarly, dried cells
of Corynebacterium sp. SH09 produced silver nanoparticles at 60 °C in
72 h on the cell wall in the size range of 10–15 nm with diamine silver
complex [Ag(NH3)2]
+ [29]. Normally, silver toxicity has been well
detoxified by small periplasmic silver-binding proteins, which bind
silver at the cell surface and by efflux pumps propels the incoming
metals and protects the cytoplasm from toxicity [30,31]. It has been
believed that the organic matrix contains silver-binding proteins that
provide amino acid moieties, which serve as nucleation sites for the
formation of silver nanoparticles. Silver precipitating peptides (AG3 and
AG4) were found to have the capability to precipitate silver from
aqueous solution of silver ions and form face-centered cubic (fcc)
structured silver crystals [32]. Recently, an airborne Bacillus sp. isolated
from the atmosphere was also found to reduce Ag+ ions to Ag0
. This
bacterium accumulated metallic silver of 5–15 nm in size in the
periplasmic space of the cell [33]. Some bacteria have been reported
for the production of more than one nanoparticle and bimetallic alloys.
Nair and Pradeep [34] found that Lactobacillus sp. in buttermilk
produced microscopic gold, silver, and gold–silver alloy crystals of
well-defined morphology within the cell with no disturbance in its
viability. Gold crystals were found as 20–50 nm in hexagonal and
triangular shapes and as clusters of N100 nm. Intracellular synthesis of
gold and silver nanoparticles by B. subtilis [17], sulfate-reducing bacteria
[19], S. algae [21], P. boryanum [22,23], E. coli [24], R. capsulatus [25],
Lactobacillus sp. [34] and by P. stutzeri [26,27], Corynebacterium sp. [29],
Bacillus sp. [33], and Lactobacillus sp. [34] showed different morphologies
such as cubic, hexagonal, spherical and hexagonal in the size range
of 5–200 nm (Table 1).
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SELTE02, a strain isolated from the
rhizospheric soil of Astragalus bisulcatus, selenium hyperaccumulator
legume, showed promising transformation of selenite (SeO3
−2
) to
elemental selenium (Se0
) accumulating selenium granules either in
the cell cytoplasm or in the extracellular space [35]. In addition, a
facultative anaerobic bacterium, Enterobacter cloacea SLD1a-1 [36], a
purple non-sulfur bacterium, Rhodospirullum rubrum in oxic and
anoxic condition [37] and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans [38] have also
been found to bioreduce selenite to selenium both inside and outside
the cell with various morphologies like spherical, fibrillar and granular
structure or with small atomic aggregates. E. coli also deposited
elemental selenium both in periplasmic space and cytoplasm [39,40]
and P. stutzeri also aerobically reduced selenite to elemental selenium
[41]. Under aerobic conditions, Hunter and Manter [42] reported a
bacterial strain Tetrathiobacter kashmirensis, which bioreduced selenite
to elemental red selenium. A 90-kDa protein present in the
cell-free extract was believed to be responsible for this bioreduction.
Recently, Yadav et al. [43] showed that P. aeruginosa SNT1 isolated
from rhizospheric seleniferous soil also biosynthesized nanostructured
selenium by biotransforming selenium oxyanions to spherical
amorphous allotrophic elemental red selenium both intracellularly
and extracellularly. When growth-decoupled, resting cells of metalion
reducing bacteria, S. algae was incubated anaerobically in aqueous
solution of H2PtCl6 at room temperature and neutral pH, it reduced
PtCl6
−2 ions within 60 min in the presence of lactate as the electron
donor to metallic platinum changing the color from pale yellow to
black (Table 1). Thus discrete platinum nanoparticles of ∼5 nm were
found to be deposited in periplasmic space between inner and outer
membrane of S. algae [44] (Fig. 2). Yet another platinum group metal
nanoparticle was produced by sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans NCIMB 8307. This bacterium anaerobically bioreduced
and biocrystallized palladium (2+) ions to palladium
nanoparticles on the surface of cells in the presence of exogenous
electron donor as formate within minutes at neutral pH [45]. De
Windt et al. [46] also showed that another iron-reducing bacterium,
S. oneidensis MR-1 in the presence of formate as the electron donor
reduced Pd(II) to Pd(0) nanoparticles on the cell wall and inside the
periplasmic space by changing the color of the biomass to black. This
cell-associated (nano-) bioPd was used as catalyst in the dechlorination
of polychlorinated biphenyl 21 (2,3,4-chloro biphenyl). Furthermore,
Mann et al. [47] studied with Aquaspirillum magnetotacticum, a
microaerophilic bacterium isolated from sediments, produced crystals
of ordered single-domain magnetite (Fe3O4) particles with morphology
of octahedral prism of {111} faces truncated by {100} faces.
Magnetosomes comprises both crystallite and non-crystallite
magnetic crystals. An ∼3 μm long cell has been found to accumulate
20 intracellular enveloped magnetite particles of diameter 40–50 nm.
Marine magnetotactic bacterium MV-1 isolated from sulfide-rich
sediments of an estuarine salt marsh anaerobically bioreduced nitrous
oxide and ferric quinate to iron-rich magnetosomes. Each magnetite
(Fe3O4) particle was parallelepipeds in dimension 40× 40 × 60 nm
with single magnetic domain [48]. Similarly, a magnetotactic
bacterium isolated from brackish and marine sulfide-rich water and
sediments intracellularly deposited single crystals of ferromagnetic
iron sulfide, greigite (Fe3S4), which was also found to be associated
with non-magnetic mineral, iron pyrite (FeS2) and aligned in chains.
Each chain contained approximately 10 nanoparticles with size of
75 nm. Most of the particles were irregular and some were octahedral
and cubo-octahedral with cubic symmetry exhibiting strong diffraction
contrast [49]. Also, Watson et al. [50] reported the synthesis of magnetic
iron sulfide nanoparticles of few nanometers of 2 nm on its surface by
sulfate-reducing bacteria. These magnetic nanoparticles were separated
from the solution by a high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) in a
field of 1 T. In nature, magnetotactic bacteria occur widely in the habitats
of marine and freshwater sediments. They produce intracellular,
membrane-bound magnetite [51], greigite [52], and pyrrhotite [53]. In
magnetotactic bacterium, Magnetospirullum magnetotacticum magnetite
nanoparticles (Fe3O4) were aligned in a chain parallel to longitudinal
axis of the cell. The single-domain crystals formed structures such as
flux-closure rings of in-plane dipoles and folded chains with dominant
dipolar forces. Each bacterial cell contained approximately 0–45
nanoparticles with polydispersity. Transmission electron microscopic
(TEM) analysis revealed the magnetite particles to be cubo-octahedrons
with irregular faceted shape. The mean equivalent sphere diameter was
47.1 nm [54]. Lee et al. [55] demonstrated that by manipulating
magnetotactic bacteria in fluid using microelectromagnets, the assembly
of magnetic nanoparticles inside the body can be controlled. In M.

magnetotacticum (MS-1), magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were found
assembled into single or multiple chains and anchored inside the body
enabling the bacteria to passively orient themselves along the
geomagnetic field lines. Each nanoparticle assembled in phospholipids
membrane of this bacterium has a cuboctahedral crystal structure with a
diameter of ∼50 nm with a magnetic moment ∼6× 10−17 A m2
.
Accumulation of magnetic iron mineral crystals into highly ordered
chain-like structures was also evidenced in the magnetosomes of M.
gryphiswaldense [56] (Fig. 3). Furthermore, a multicellular magnetotactic
bacterium, Candidatus Magnetoglobus multicellularis, was also found to
interact with geomagnetic field with the use of biomineralized magnetic
nanocrystals [57]. Magnetite nanoparticles formed by bacteria such as A.
magnetotacticum [47], Magnetotactic bacterium MV-1 [48], Sulfatereducing
bacteria [50], M. magnetotacticum [54], M. magnetotacticum
(MS-1) [55] and M. gryphiswaldense [56] showed predominant
morphologies of octahedral prism, parallelepiped, cubo-octahedral and
hexagonal prism in the size range of 2–120 nm (Table 1).
The radionuclides in the soluble form imposes a significant threat to
life by contaminating soils and sediments, to tackle this problem, the
microbial activity of fixing the soluble form to insoluble can be exploited.
In that way, Desulfosporosinus sp., a Gram-positive sulfate-reducing
microbe isolated from sediments when incubated with mobile hexavalent
uranium U(VI) reduced to tetravalent uranium U(IV) which
precipitated uraninite. These uraninite (UO2) crystals coated on the cell
surface of Desulfosporosinus spp. were in the size range of 1.5–2.5 nm
[58] (Fig. 4). Metal semiconductor nanocrystals have wide spread
applications in various fields of research particularly in biomedical fields.
Cunningham and Lundie [59] demonstrated that within 24–48 h after
the addition of CdCl2 and 0.05% cysteine hydrochloride, Clostridium
thermoaceticum in late exponential- to early-stationary phase precipitated
bright yellow CdS crystals on the surfaces of the cells as well as in
the medium. Here, desulfhydration of cysteine was the source of sulfide
for CdS precipitation by cysteine desulfhydrase activity and in a similar
process, Smith et al. [60] produced “bio-semiconductor” CdS nanoparticles
in the size range of 5–200 nm on the cell surface of Klebsiella
pneumoniae. These “Bio-CdS” possessed the optical and photoactive
traits analogous to the chemically synthesized CdS. Few years ago,
Sweeney et al.[61] showed that E. coli can also intracellularly accumulate
semiconductor nanocrystals composed of wurtzite crystal in the size
range of 2–5 nm with spherical and elliptical shapes, when incubated
with CdCl2 and sodium sulfide. The production of nanocrystal was
20-fold higher when E. coli cells grown to stationary phase compared to
late logarithmic phase. It was also found that spherical aggregates of 2- to
5-nm diameter sphalerite (ZnS) particles were formed within the
natural biofilms dominated by aerotolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria of
the family Desulfobacteriaceae [62] (Table 1). Among semiconductor
nanocrystals, CdS synthesized by C. thermoaceticum [59], Klebsiella
pneumoniae [60] and E. coli [61] showed spherical and elliptical shape in

the size of 2–200 nm and ZnS produced by Desulfobacteriaceae [62]
exhibited spherical morphology with 2–5 nm in size (Table 1).
2.2. Extracellular synthesis of nanoparticles by bacteria
Microbial synthesis of metal nanoparticles depends up on the
localization of the reductive components of the cell. When the cell wall
reductive enzymes or soluble secreted enzymes are involved in the
reductive process of metal ions then it is obvious to find the metal
nanoparticles extracellularly. The extracellular production of nanoparticles
has wider applications in optoelectronics, electronics, bioimaging
and in sensor technology than intracellular accumulation. Rhodopseudomonas
capsulata, a prokaryotic bacterium was found to reduce Au+3
to Au0 at room temperature [63]. TEM analysis showed that particles
were mainly spherical in the size range of 10–20 nm at pH 7.0. But with
the change in pH of the solution, various shapes and sizes were formed.
At pH 4.0, triangular nanoparticles also appeared along with spherical
nanoparticles. These triangular nanoparticles were in the size of
50–400 nm and spherical particles with a size of 10–50 nm. Optimization
of conditions for the synthesis of anisotrophic gold nanostructures
with different concentrations of gold ions were also reported [64]. Here,
cell-free extract of R. capsulata was added with lower concentration of
gold ions to produce spherical gold nanoparticles in the size of
10–20 nm. But highly networked structures of gold nanowires with
50–60 nm were synthesized with higher concentrations of gold ions.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE)
analysis revealed the involvement of one or more proteins (14–98 kDa)
in the bioreduction and capping the gold nanoparticles. Among
hyperthermophilic and mesophilic dissimilatory Fe(III) reducing bacteria
and archea like Pyrobalaculum islandicum, Thermotoga maritime,
S. algae, G. sulfurreducens and Pyrococcus furiosus gold was precipitated
by reducing gold(III) to metallic gold in the presence of hydrogen as
electron donor. The precipitation occurred extracellularly due to the
presence of Au(III) reductases near the outer cell surfaces of Fe(III)
reducers [20]. Husseiny et al. [65] demonstrated that P. aeruginosa
(ATCC 90271, strain1 and strain2) synthesized gold nanoparticles
extracellularly with particle size distribution in the order of 40±10 nm,
25±15 nm and 15± 5 nm respectively. As the particle size has
increased the color was found to be shifted from pink to blue color
due to the SPR of gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, the dried powder of
B. megatherium D01 was also used to reduce gold salts into
monodispersed gold nanoparticles and dodecanethiol was used as
capping ligand to stabilize the particles at 26 °C. TEM analysis revealed
the effect of thiol on the shape, size and dispersity of gold nanoparticles.
The presence of thiol during biosynthesis indicated the formation of
small spherical gold nanoparticles with 1.9±0.8 nm in size [66]. In
analogous, silver nanoparticles were also found to be produced by dried
cells of Aeromonas sp. SH10, which reduced [Ag(NH3)2]
+ to Ag0 in 4 h
with an average diameter of Ca. 6.4 nm. These particles were monodispersed
and uniform in size and remained stable for more than
6 months without aggregation and precipitation [67]. The culture
supernatants of Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumonia, E. coli and
Enterobacter cloacae) also rapidly synthesized silver nanoparticles by
reducing Ag+ to Ag0
. These particles ranged in size from 28.2 nm to
122 nm with an average size of 52.5 nm.With the addition of piperitone,
silver ion reduction was partially inhibited, which showed the
involvement of nitroreductase enzymes in the reduction process [68].
Similarly, the culture supernatant of non-pathogenic bacteria, B.
licheniformis was used for the extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles
of ∼50 nm [69]. Barud et al. [70] also demonstrated the
formation of homogenous silver containing bacterial cellulose (BC)
membranes obtained from BC hydrated membranes of Acetobacter
xylinum cultures soaked on silver ion with triethanolamine (Ag+-TAE)
solution (Table 1).
Recently, it has been found that the HIV-1 virus binds exclusively
to silver nanoparticles whose size is in the range of 1–10 nm [71].
Morganella sp., a silver-resistant bacterium isolated from the insect
gut belonging to enterobacteriaceae was reported to produce
nanoparticles of 20± 5 nm in size with spherical morphology and
characteristic d-spacing of 2.02 for the [200] plane [72]. Three gene
homologues namely silE, silP and silS were identified in silver-resistant
Morganella sp. On basis of partial nucleotide sequencing silE, silP and
silS homologues were identified as periplasmic silver-binding protein,
cation-transporting P-type ATPase and two-component membrane
sensor kinase involved in silver resistance mechanism. Bacteria,
R. capsulata [63,64], P. aeruginosa [65] and B. megatherium D01 [66]
extracellularly produced gold nanoparticles with spherical, triangular
nanoplates and nanowires morphologies in the size range of 1.9–400 nm.
Interestingly, it was also found that extracellular synthesis of silver
nanoparticles documented from other bacteria such as Aeromonas sp.
SH10 [67], E. cloacae, K. pneumonia, E. coli [68], B. licheniformis [69], A.
xylinum [70] andMorganella sp.[72] showed only sphericalmorphology in
the size range between 6.4 and 52.5 nm (Table 1).
Selenium has photo-optical and semiconducting properties that
have applications in photocopiers and microelectronic circuit devices.
Few selenite- and selenate-respiring bacteria such as Sulfurospirillum
barnesii, B. selenitireducens and Selenihalanaerobacter shriftii synthesized
extracellularly stable uniform nanospheres of diameter ∼300 nm of
elemental selenium Se0 with monoclinic crystalline structures. These
bacteria have also produced small amounts of Se0 intracellularly [73].
Microbial synthesis of elemental selenium (Se0
) nanospheres resulted
in unique, complex, compacted nanostructured arrangements of Se
atoms. These arrangements were resulted due to the dissimilatory
reductions that were subtly different in different microbes. Another
metalloid semiconductor, tellurium belonging to chalcogen family has
been reduced from tellurite to elemental tellurium by two anaerobic
bacteria, B. selenireducens and Sulfurospirillum barnesii. In case of
B. selenireducens, initially formed nanorods of ∼10 nm in diameter and
200 nm in length were clustered together to form larger rosettes of
∼1000 nm but with S. barnesii small irregularly shaped extracellular
nanospheres of diameter b50 nm were formed (Table 1). Selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses demonstrated the formation of composition and formation of
tellurium (Te) in crystalline nature [74]. Titanium nanoparticles of
spherical aggregates of 40–60 nm were produced extracellularly using
the culture filtrate of Lactobacillus sp. at room temperature [75]. These
titanium nanoparticles were lighter in weight and high resistance to
corrosion and have enormous applications in automobiles, missiles,
airplanes, submarines, cathode ray tubes and in desalting plants and has
promising future role in cancer chemotherapy and gene delivery. Unlike
in abiotic conditions, an ancient Gram-negative cyanobacterium,
P. boryanum UTEX 485, extracellularly produced Pt(II)-organics and
metallic platinum nanoparticles at 25–100 °C for up to 28 days, and
180 °C for 1 day with different morphologies of spherical, bead-like
chains and dendritic in the size range of 30 nm–0.3 µm. This has been
shown as first viable alternative method to standard abiotic chemical
based synthesis of platinum particles [76].
Magnetite particles have also been produced extracellularly by nonmagnetotactic
bacterium Geobacter metallireducensGS-15, isolated from
the sediments of Potomac river, in anaerobic growth conditions [7]. In a
dissimilatory process, amorphous ferric oxide was reduced to magnetite
during the reduction of ferric iron as the terminal electron acceptor for
organic matter oxidation. Thus ultrafine-grained magnetic black
precipitate crystals were formed in 10–50 nm in size showing
characteristic diffraction pattern of magnetite [7]. Single-domain
octahedral magnetite nanoparticles of b12 nm were formed of equal
length and width at 25 °C outside the bacterial cells by a thermophilic
fermentative bacterial strain TOR-39. These crystals were similar in sizes
and shapes produced intracellularly by other magnetotactic bacteria
[77]. Intriguingly, it has been found that bacteria can act as catalysts by
extracting some electrochemical energy to live, after which electrons
were shed to their surroundings at a potential that precipitates
6 K.B. Narayanan, N. Sakthivel / Advances in Colloid and Interface Science 156 (2010) 1–13
magnetite. Roh et al. [78] demonstrated bacterially-mediated electrochemical
process, in which under anaerobic conditions, a fermentative
Fe(III) reducing bacteria, TOR-39, Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus in a
well-buffered medium of pH 6.9–8.5 synthesized octahedral shaped
transition metals (Co, Cr and Ni)-substituted magnetic crystals by
electrochemical process at ambient temperature. Furthermore, Bharde
et al. [79] reported Actinobacter sp., a non-magnetotactic aerobic
bacterium produced magnetite crystals extracellularly after 24 h.
Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis showed the magnetite
crystals of quasi-spherical morphology with 10–40 nm size. The
induction of two proteins of MW 120 and 70 kDa were involved in the
biotransformation of aqueous solution of potassium ferricyanide and
potassium ferrocyanide as iron precursors in to magnetite at room
temperature in fully aerobic condition. G. metallireducens [7], thermophilic
bacteria TOR-39 [77] and Actinobacter sp. [79] produced
magnetite extracellularly with octahedral and quasi-spherical morphologies
in the size range of 10–50 nm (Table 1).
Like gold, uranium is soluble in the oxidized form, U(VI), but the
reduced form of uranium, U(IV), is insoluble. Micrococcus lactilyticus
cell-free extracts reduced U(VI) to U(IV) [80]. Alteromonas putrefaciens
grown in the presence of hydrogen as electron donor and U(VI)
as electron acceptor also reduced U(VI) to U(IV) [81,82]. Similarly,
Lovley et al. [83] demonstrated that G. metallireducens GS-15, when
grown anaerobically in the presence of acetate and U(VI) as electron
donor and electron acceptor reduced soluble uranium U(VI) to
insoluble U(IV) oxidizing acetate to CO2. Marshall et al. [84] found
that c-type cytochrome (MtrC) on the outer membrane and
extracellular of dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium, S. oneidensis
MR-1 was involved in the reduction of U(VI) predominantly with
extracellular polymeric substance as UO2-EPS in cell suspension and
intracellularly in periplasm (Table 1). Klebsiella aerogenes synthesized
CdS crystallites of spherical shape as bound to the cell wall and as
detached electron-dense particles in the dimension of 20- to 200-nm
when exposed to Cd2+ in the growth medium. Energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX) established that cadmium and sulfur in 1:1
ratio [85]. Bai et al. [86] showed that Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a
purple non-sulfur, photosynthetic bacterium extracellularly synthesized
CdS nanocrystals at room temperature. TEM and electron
diffraction analyses confirmed the spherical distribution of fcc structured
nanoparticles of size in 8.01± 0.25 nm. The cysteine desulfhydrase
(C-S lyase) activity was found to be responsible for the
formation of CdS nanocrystals and also found that bacterial cellulose
(BC) isolated from the strain Gluconoacetobacter xylinus was also used
in the synthesis of CdS nanoparticle of 30 nm deposited on BC
nanofibres [87]. Immobilized Rhodobacter sphaeroides extracellularly
produced spherical shaped zinc sulfide (ZnS) semiconductor nanoparticles
of 8 nm in size [88]. In analogous, immobilized purple, nonsulfur
photosynthetic bacterium, R. sphaeroides produced extracellularly
fcc structured lead sulfide (PbS) nanoparticles of size 10.5±
0.15 nm with monodispersed spherical morphology [89] (Fig. 5). All
these bacteria, K. aerogenes [85], R. palustris [83], G. xylinus [87] and R.
sphaeroides [88] produced only spherical shaped semiconductor
nanocrystals in the size range of 8–200 nm in size (Table 1). With
an immense capability, a metal-tolerant marine bacterium, Brevibacterium
casei also extracellularly synthesized cubic spinel-structured
single-crystalline ferromagnetic Co3O4 nanoparticles functionalized
with proteins in the size range 5–7 nm using aqueous cobalt acetate as
precursor at room temperature [90] (Table 1).
3. Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by fungi
In recent years, fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum [91–100],
Colletotrichum sp. [101], Trichothecium sp., Trichoderma asperellum,
T. viride, [102–104], Phaenerochaete chrysosporium [105], F. solani USM

3799 [106], F. semitectum [107], A. fumigatus [108], Coriolus versicolor
[109], Aspergillus niger [110], Phoma glomerata [111], Penicillium
brevicompactum [112], Cladosporium cladosporioides [113], Penicillium
fellutanum [114] and Volvariella volvaceae [115] have been explored
for nanoparticles synthesis. Fungi are more advantageous compared
to other microorganisms in many ways. Fungal mycelial mesh can
withstand flow pressure and agitation and other conditions in
bioreactors or other chambers compared to plant materials and bacteria.
These are fastidious to grow and easy to handle and easy for fabrication.
The extracellular secretions of reductive proteins are more and can be
easily handled in downstream processing. And also, since the
nanoparticles precipitated outside the cell is devoid of unnecessary
cellular components, it can be directly used in various applications.
3.1. Intracellular synthesis of nanoparticles by fungi
The nanoparticles formed inside the organism could be smaller
compared with the size of extracellularly reduced nanoparticles. The
size limit could have been related to the particles nucleating inside the
organisms. Mukherjee et al. [116] demonstrated the use of eukaryotic
microorganisms in the biological synthesis of gold nanoparticles using
Verticillium sp. (AAT-TS-4). In this study, synthesis of gold nanoparticles
was reported on the surface and on the cytoplasmic membrane
of fungal mycelium, which were around 20 nm in diameter. These
formed nanoparticles have well-defined dimensions and good
dispersity. On TEM analysis, ultrathin sections of fungal mycelia
showed the spherical and few triangles and hexagonal nanoparticles
on cell wall and quasi-hexagonal morphology on cytoplasmic
membrane. Trichothecium sp. was found to accumulate gold nanoparticles
intracellularly [102]. In addition, Verticillium luteoalbum and
isolate 6–3 produced gold nanoparticles in 24 h. When V. luteoalbum
was incubated at pH 3.0, spherical particles of b10 nm diameter but
with pH 5.0 spheres and rods were also observed along with
triangular and hexagonal morphologies [117,118]. Phoma PT35 was
able to selectively accumulate silver [119] and Phoma sp.3.2883 was,
in fact, a biosorbent suited for preparing silver nanoparticles [120].
Verticillium sp. fungal biomass on exposure to aqueous silver nitrate
solution resulted in the accumulation of silver nanoparticles below
the fungal cell surface with a negligible amount on the solution
[92,121]. Recently, Vigneshwaran et al. [122] also showed that the use
of Aspergillus flavus resulted in the accumulation of silver nanoparticles
on the surface of its cell wall when incubated with silver nitrate
solution for 72 h. The average particle size was found to be 8.92 nm
(Table 2). Intracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles produced by
Verticillium sp. [116], Trichothecium sp. [102] and V. luteoalbum
[117,118] and silver nanoparticles by Verticillium sp. [92,121] and
Aspergillus flavus [122] showed morphologies of spherical, quasihexagonal
and rods in the size range of 8.92–25 nm (Table 2).

3.2. Extracellular synthesis of nanoparticles by fungi
Synthesis of nanoparticles outside the cell, extracellularly, has
many applications as it is void of unnecessary adjoining cellular
components from the cell. Mostly, fungi are regarded as the organisms
that produce nanoparticles extracellularly because of their enormous
secretory components, which involve in the reduction and capping of
nanoparticles. Shankar et al. [123] found an endophytic fungus,
Colletotrichum sp. isolated from the leaves of geranium plant (Pelargonium
graveolens), which rapidly reduced gold ions to zero-valent gold
nanoparticles. It was spherical in shape and polydispersed. These gold
nanoparticles exhibited a mixture of flat disk and rod-like morphology.
Glutathiones that bind either through free amine group or cysteine
residues were reported as capping agents of gold nanoparticles [124].
TEM analysis showed the size of the gold particles in the range of
8–40 nm. Similarly, when the fungus Trichothecium sp. was cultured in
static condition, it reduced Au+3 to form gold nanoparticles [102]. TEM
images showed the shapes of triangle and hexagonal gold nanoparticles
with highly polydispersed spheres and rod-like structures. The average
size of dimension of these gold nanoparticles was found to be 5–200 nm
and the Scherrer ring pattern was characteristic of fcc gold. The release of
some loosely bound specific enzymes or proteins by the fungal
Trichothecium sp. mat in the solution was involved in the synthesis of
nanoparticles of different morphology (Table 2).
Bhainsa and D'Souza [108] reported the use of Aspergillus fumigatus
in the production of monodispersed silver nanoparticles of size 5–25 nm
with in 10 min when silver nitrate was added. TEM micrograph showed
the nanoparticles with variable shapes predominantly in spherical and
with triangular. This is the fastest reduction by a biological process and
even compared with physical and chemical process. Extracellular
synthesis of pyramidal morphology of silver nanoparticles was reported
in white rot fungus P. chrysosporium when challenged with silver
nitrate. Environmental SEM analysis revealed that silver nanoparticles
were in the size range of 50–200 nm on the surface of the mycelium.
This demonstrated the presence of reductase enzymes on the surface of
the mycelium, which reduced silver ions to silver nanoparticles [105].
The presence of thick capping agent provided more stabilization to the
polydispersed silver nanoparticles. Also, Basavaraja et al. [107]
demonstrated that when culture filtrate of F. semitectum was treated
with silver ions it reduces to silver nanoparticles with size range of
10–60 nm with spherical morphology indicating polydispersity. This
was found to be stable for many weeks. Similarly, Aspergillus niger
isolated from soil produced spherical silver nanoparticles of size 20 nm
in diameter. Elemental spectroscopy demonstrated the presence of
fungal protein for the stabilization of the nanoparticles. The reduction of
Ag+ ions has occurred by the action of nitrate reductase enzyme and
quinine in extracellular electron transfer [110]. In addition, F. solani
(USM-3799), a phytopathogenic fungus of onion produced polydispersed
spherical silver nanoparticles in the range of 16.23 nm [106]
(Table 2).
Extracellular mycosynthesis of silver nanoparticles by F. acuminatum
EII. and Ev. (USM-3793) isolated from infected ginger was studied by
Ingle et al. [125]. The nanoparticles produced were in the size range of
5–40 nm with spherical morphology. The non-pathogenic and biocontrol
agent, Trichoderma asperellum, also produced silver nanoparticles in
the size range of 13–18 nm with well-defined morphology and stability
over several months [103]. These silver ions reduction process followed
Michaelis–Menten type of mechanisms with pseudo-zero-order kinetics.
The fungal filtrate of P. glomerata showed the synthesis of spherical
silver nanoparticles in the range of 60–80 nm when challenged with
silver nitrate. These nanoparticles also exhibited antibacterial activity
against E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus [111]. Fungal
proteins by white rot fungus, C. versicolor, have been used as bioreducing
and biocapping agents to produce extra- and intracellular silver
nanoparticles in alkaline condition [109] (Table 2). TEM analysis
showed the shape of the silver nanoparticles of spherical morphology
extra- and intracellularly with 25–75 nm and 444–491 nm respectively.
Very recently, Kathiresan et al. [114] isolated a rhizospheric fungus,
P. fellutanum, from mangrove root-soil of Rhizophora annamalayana
Kathir, was found to produce silver nanoparticles in 24 h. TEM studies
revealed the shape as spherical with size ranging from 5 to 25 nm. The
partial purification of the fungal protein of 70 kDa was involved in
nanoparticles formation. Fayaz et al. [104] investigated the antimicrobial
activity of silver nanoparticles produced by T. viride. Similarly, by
employing the fungal isolate P. brevicompactum WA2315, the biosynthesis
of silver nanoparticles was reported from compactin in 72 h [112].
The synthesized silver particles were in the size range of 23–105 nm. In
addition, Balaji et al. [113] showed the production of extracellular silver
nanoparticles by fungus C. cladosporioides. TEM analysis revealed the
presence of polydispersed and spherical shaped particles. The proteins,
polysaccharides and organic acids secreted by the fungus were believed
to have facilitated the formation of different crystal shapes and directed
the growth into spherical crystals.
The extract of saprophytic straw mushroom fungus, V. volvacea was
used to produce silver, gold, gold–silver nanoparticles [115]. Gold
nanoparticles were found to be of different shapes from triangular
nanoprisms to spherical and hexagonal were obtained with size ranged
from 20 to 150 nm whereas silver nanoparticles were spherical with a
size ∼15 nm and the Au–Ag bimetallic nanoparticles were formed by
co-reduction of both metal ions. It indicated the core–shell structure
with thick shell or alloy nanoparticles. As the molar ratio of Au:Ag
increased, the SPR became more intense and sharper [115]. Intriguingly,
F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, was found to produce platinum
nanoparticles intercellularly, on cell wall or membrane and extracellularly
in the medium in the size range between 10 and 100 nm and with
varying shapes of triangles, hexagons, squares and rectangles [98] and
the plant fungus, Verticillum sp., was involved in the process of
formation of cubo-octahedral iron oxide nanoparticles with
100–400 nm size in 24 h. These cubo-octahedrals composed of
10–40 nm sized cubic magnetite particles. The secretion of cationic
proteins with the molecular weight of 55 kDa and 13 kDa were found to
be responsible for the hydrolysis of magnetite precursors and/or
capping the magnetite nanoparticles [126] (Table 2).
Among fungi, F. oxysporum is the only fungus, which has been
completely explored and exploited to the maximum for the
production of various nanoparticles. It extracellularly synthesized
various nanoparticles like gold, silver, bimetallic Au–Ag alloy, silica,
titania, zirconia, quantum dots, magnetite, strontianite, Bi2O3 and
barium titanate. In 2002, Mukherjee et al. [91] reported the synthesis
of spherical and triangular gold nanoparticles in the size range of
20–40 nm. FTIR spectrum showed the presence of amide (I) and (II)
bands from carbonyl and amine stretch vibrations in proteins
respectively. Electrophoresis revealed the protein of molecular mass
between 66 kDa and 10 kDa involved in nanoparticles stabilization.
Zirconia nanoparticles were produced by cationic proteins secreted by
F. oxysporum when incubated with ZrF6
−2 anions. The protein of
molecular weight 24–28 kDa was found to be responsible for the
formation of zirconia nanoparticles [94]. The particles were overall
quasi-spherical in shape with size range between 3–11 nm. Senapati
et al. [92,93] showed the formation of extracellular silver nanoparticles
and bimetallic gold–silver (Au–Ag) alloy nanoparticles by
F. oxysporum. Because of their unique electronic and structural
properties, Au–Ag alloy nanoparticles can be used in biomedical
applications. Strontianite (SrCO3) crystals of needlelike morphology
with higher order quasi-linear superstructures with aqueous Sr+ 3
ions were reported [97]. Since the source of carbonate ions that
reacted with strontium ions was the fungus itself. This procedure was
called “total biological synthesis”. Similarly, it also produced silica and
titania nanoparticles with SiF6
−2 and TiF6
−2 anionic complexes, which
resulted in the synthesis of crystalline titania in room temperature
and calcinations at 300 °C for crystallization of silica [95]. In addition,
it also produced ternary oxide, barium titanate nanoparticles (BaTiO3)
K.B. Narayanan, N. Sakthivel / Advances in Colloid and Interface Science 156 (2010) 1–13 9
of irregular quasi-spherical morphology with an average size of 4±
1 nm at room temperature. SAED confirmed the crystalline nature of
tetragonal phase of nanoparticles, which exhibited a well-defined
ferroelectric–paraelectric transition at room temperature which can
be useful in microelectronics [91]. With the mixture of salts K3[Fe
(CN)6] and K4[Fe(CN)6] after 24 h, it produced crystalline magnetite
nanoparticles with single-domain characteristics. These particles
were quasi-spherical in shape with 20–50 nm in size [126]. Similarly,
upon incubation with CdCl2 and SeCl4, it produced highly luminescent
water soluble quantum dots (CdSe) with SPR band at 370 nm at room
temperature [99]. These particles were stable with ∼6–7 ns fluorescence
half life and showed polydispersed spherical morphology with
9–15 nm size (Table 2). Although Fusarium species can produce
various nanoparticles widely, it is not applicable to all Fusarium sp.
F. moniliforme, which produces reducing components could not be
able to form silver nanoparticles up on incubation with silver ions
[127]. Furthermore, the deposition of bismuth was reported on the
periphery of Yersinia enterocolitica 8081c cultures in log phase growth
with bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) [128]. Very recently, it was also
shown that F. oxysporum produced optoelectronic material Bi2O3
nanocrystals in the size between 5–8 nm extracellularly with quasispherical
morphology and good tunable properties. When bismuth
nitrate was added as precursor, the as-synthesized nanocrystals were
in monoclinic and tetragonal phases [100]. F. oxysporum [91],
Colletotrichum sp. [123] and Trichothecium sp. [102] produced
extracellular gold nanoparticles with spherical, triangular and
hexagonal morphologies with 5–200 nm in size. It was also intriguing
to observe that the silver nanoparticles produced by T. asperellum
[103], T. viride [104], F. oxysporum [92], P. chrysosporium [105], F. solani
[106], F. semitectum [107], F. acuminatum [125], A. fumigatus [108],
C. versicolor [109], A. niger [110], P. glomerata [111], P. brevicompactum
[112], C. cladosporioides [113], P. fellutanum [114] and V. volvacea
[115] were predominantly spherical with pyramidal, rod-like and
triangular morphologies in the size of 5–200 nm (Table 2).
Microbes have evolved various measures to respond to heavy metal
stress via processes such as transport across cell membrane, entrapment
in extracellular capsules, precipitation, complexation and oxidation–
reduction reactions [129]. In microbial bioreduction processes, myriads
of proteins, carbohydrates and biomembranes are involved. The
enzymatic route of in vitro synthesis of silver hydrosol of 10–25 nm
using α-NADPH-dependent nitrate reductase (44 kDa) from F. oxysporum
with capping peptide, phytochelatin was demonstrated recently
[130]. The mechanistic aspect was explained by Duran et al. [127] that
apart from enzymes, quinine derivates of napthoquinones and
anthraquinones also act as redox centres in the reduction of silver
nanoparticles. A similar finding was also reported in the reduction of
gold(III) chloride to metallic gold by α-NADPH-dependent sulfite
reductase of molecular mass of 35.6 kDa and phytochelatin [131]. A
dimeric hydrogenase enzyme (44.5 and 39.4 kDa) of F. oxysporum that
showed optimum activity at pH 7.5 and 38 °C passively reduced H2PtCl6
to platinum nanoparticles was also reported [132] (Table 3). To date,
only very few reports have been documented on optimization in
biological process, a 29-kDa “gold shape-directing protein (GSP)”
present in the extract of green algae Chlorella vulgaris was used in the
bioreduction and in the synthesis of shape-and size-controlled
distinctive triangular and hexagonal gold nanoparticles. With increase
in the concentration of GSP produced gold plates with lateral sizes upto
micrometers [133]. Such mechanistic components should be unravelled
for efficient biological processes.
4. Actinomycete mediated synthesis of nanoparticles
Actinomycetes though have classified as prokaryotes as they share
important characteristics of fungi. They are popularly known as ray
fungi. A novel extremophilic actinomycete, Thermomonospora sp. was
found to synthesis extracellular monodispersed spherical gold
nanoparticles at an average size of 8 nm [134]. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) analysis confirmed the presence of
amide (I) and (II) bands of protein as capping and stabilizing agent on
the surface of nanoparticles. These particles were stable for more than
6 months. Electrophoresis analysis showed that the proteins of
molecular weight ranged from 80 kDa to 10 kDa were involved in
stabilization of nanoparticles. In contrast, an alkalotolerant actinomycete,
Rhodococcus sp. intracellularly accumulated gold nanoparticles
with a dimension of 5–15 nm (Table 4). The available of
reductases on the cell wall reduced Au+ 3 and accumulated as Au0
on the cell wall and on cytoplasmic membrane with good dispersity
[135]. Till date, actinomycetes are regarded as the primary source for
the synthesizing secondary metabolites like antibiotics in general. But
these new discoveries would take a lead in screening of further
actinomycetes in the synthesis of nanomaterials.
5. Yeast mediated synthesis of nanoparticles
Among the eukaryotic microorganism, yeast has been exploited
mainly for the synthesis of semiconductors. Candida glubrata
produced intracellularly monodispersed spherically shaped peptideTable

bound CdS quantum crystallites of 20 Å by neutralizing the toxicity of
metal ions by forming metal–thiolate complex with phytochelatins
[136] and Schizosaccharomyces pombe also produced wurtzite-typed
hexagonal lattice structured CdS nanoparticles in mid-log phase in the
range of 1–1.5 nm [137]. Kowshik et al. [138] first reported the
synthesis of fcc structured PbS nanocrystallites exhibiting quantum
semiconductor properties by yeast, Torulopsis sp. which intracellularly
produced in the vacuoles with a dimension of 2–5 nm in spherical
morphology when incubated with Pb2+ exhibiting λmax of 330 nm in
UV–Vis spectrophotometer. These nanoparticles were used to
fabricate diode heterojunction with poly (p-phenylenevinylene). In
addition, baker's yeast, S. cerevisiae was also reported to biosorb and
reduces Au+ 3 to elemental gold in the peptidoglycan layer of the cell
wall in situ by the aldehyde group present in reducing sugars [139].
Similarly, another yeast Pichia jadinii (Candida utilis), intracellularly
formed gold nanoparticles of spherical, triangular and hexagonal
morphologies throughout the cell mainly in the cytoplasm of size
b100 nm in 24 h [117,118]. This tropical marine yeast, Yarrowia
lipolytica NCIM 3589, also synthesized gold nanoparticles associated
with cell wall. The reduction of gold ions occurred in pH dependent
manner. When cells were incubated at pH 2.0, it produced hexagonal
and triangular gold crystals due to the nucleation on the cell surfaces
giving rise to golden color in the visible region at 540 nm at pH 7.0 and
pH 9.0 with pink and purple colors with an average size of ∼15 nm
[140]. Yet again, S. cerevisiae was also found to produce spherical
shaped face-centered cubic unit cell antimony oxide (Sb2O3)
nanoparticles in the size of 2–10 nm at room temperature exhibiting
semiconductor properties. This was possibly due to the radial
tautomerization of membrane-bound quinines or by membranebound
or cytosolic pH-dependent oxidoreductases [141]. Extracellular
production of silver nanoparticles was reported only in yeast MKY3, a
silver tolerant strain, which synthesized hexagonal silver nanoparticles
(2–5 nm) in log phase of growth [142] (Table 4).
6. Virus mediated biosynthesis of nanoparticles
Some biological molecules like fatty acids, amino acids, and
polyphates are used as template in the growth of semiconductor
nanocrystals. In particular, by changing the ratio of different fatty
acids (chain lengths), shapes of CdSe, CdS and CdTe nanocrystals can
be achieved [2,143]. Some other biological methodologies are also
available for eco-friendly synthesis of inorganic materials. Biological
materials like DNA [144–146], protein cages [147], biolipid cylinders
[148,149], viroid capsules [150], bacterial rapidosomes [151], S-layers
[152] and multicellular superstructures [153] have been used in
template-mediated synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles and microstructures.
Interestingly, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was used as
template for the synthesis of iron oxides by oxidative hydrolysis,
co-crystallization of CdS and PbS, and the synthesis of SiO2 by sol–gel
condensation. It happened with the help of external groups of
glutamate and aspartate on the external surface of the virus [154].
Self-assembled viral capsids of genetically engineered viruses were
exploited as biological templates for the assembly of quantum dot
nanowires (Table 4). The peptides like A7 and J140, which have the
ability to nucleate ZnS and CdS nanocrystals were expressed as pVIII
fusion proteins into the crystalline capsid of the virus, M13
bacteriophages. These organized template peptides (A7/J140-pVIIIM13)
were selected by using a pIII phage display and exposed to
semiconductor precursor solutions. ZnS nanocrystals assembled on
the viral capsid were found to be of hexagonal wurtzite of ∼5 nm or
CdS assembled as nanowires of 3–5 nm. Hybrid nanowires (ZnS–CdS)
were achieved with a dual peptide virus engineered to express A7 and
J140 within the same viral capsid [155,156] (Fig. 6).
7. Conclusions
Increasing awareness towards green chemistry and biological
processes has led to a desire to develop an environment-friendly
approach for the synthesis of non-toxic nanoparticles. Unlike other
processes in physical and chemical methods, which involve hazardous
chemicals, microbial biosynthesis of nanoparticles is cost-effective
and eco-friendly approach. Therefore, microbial synthesis of nanoparticles
has been emerged as an important branch of nanobiotechnology
[157,158]. Due to their rich diversity, microbes have the innate
potential for the synthesis of nanoparticles and they could be
regarded as potential biofactories for nanoparticles synthesis. However,
to improve the rate of synthesis and monodispersity of
nanoparticles, factors such as microbial cultivation methods and
downstream processing techniques have to be improved and the
combinatorial approach such as photobiological methods may be
used. The delineation of specific genes and characterization of
enzymes that involve in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles is also
required. Thus, the complete knowledge on the underlying molecular
mechanisms that mediate the microbial synthesis of nanoparticles is
mandate to control the size and shape as well as crystallinity of
nanoparticles. Future research on microbes-mediated biological
synthesis of nanoparticles with unique optoelectronics, physicochemical
and electronic properties are of great importance for applications
in the areas of chemistry, electronics, medicine and agriculture
[157,158].
