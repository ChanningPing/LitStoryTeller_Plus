confirm the model of a Schottky barrier with subsequent charge transfer across the semiconductor(catalyst)-electrolyte interface.Values of the Helmholtz capacity both at bare p-InP under low current densities and at electrodes coated with monolayer amounts of platinum were found to be smaller (approximately 1 muF cm-2) than typical values for metallic surfaces.The consequences of this finding,

experimental data on the photocurrent-time dependence observed during the photoassisted oxidation of water at a H-2 reduced (001) TiO2 rutile single crystal, as a function of the concentration of

the second-order rate constant, k2, for H2O2 generation from the recombination of surface-bound OH-degrees(s) radicals, photogenerated by hole trapping at Ti-coordinated OH- ions of basic character.k2 is found to increase linearly with the concentration of donor centers, N(D), in the range (1.5 - 43) x 10(17) cm-3, from 7.0 x 10(-15) to 8.5 x 10(-14) cm2 s-1.The apparent increase of the catalytic activity of TiO2 surface in the photooxidation of H2O to H2O2 is attributed to the formation of Ti2O3 corundum type lattice defects during TiO2 reduction process in H-2.The catalytic properties of these defects are thought to be associated with the short distance between Ti3+ pairs, which makes easy covalent bonding between adsorbed OH-degrees(s) radicals.The k2 rate constant at corundum catalytic units is estimated to be about 5 orders of magnitude greater than that corresponding to nondefective TiO2 rutile areas (i.e., almost-equal-to 5 x 10(-10) vs almost-equal-to 5 x 10(-15) cm2

respectively, for the five axially oriented C-D bonds and the single equatorially oriented C-D bond of the D-myo-inositol headgroup.Between R(W/L) ratios of 129 and 210 and between 30-degrees-C and 80-degrees-C the value of the ratio of these splittings DELTAnu(ax)/DELTAnu(eq) varies significantly (between 1.17 and 4.38).If it is assumed that, at a particular temperature, there is a single preferred orientation of the inositol headgroup, and that motion of the DPMI molecule establishes axial symmetry with respect to the bilayer normal then the ratio of these quadrupolar splittings can be used to impose constraints on that orientation.For example, the data are inconsistent with a situation in which the inositol ring lies parallel to the membrane surface and are difficult to reconcile with an arrangement where the inositol ring lies perpendicular to the surface.Computational modelling identifies four possible 'tilted' orientations, ail of which are consistent with the data, and two of these allow good intramolecular hydrogen bonds to be formed.In one there is hydrogen bonding between the inositol C2-OH and the phosphate pro-R oxygen.This is close to the

reducing the pH was found to coincide with the appearance of three strong H-1 ENDOR resonances, reflecting symmetrization of the first two solvation shells.From the dipolar part of the hyperfine interaction, the Mn-H distances for the first and second shells were determined to be 2.87 and 4.8 angstrom, respectively.All protons in the first shell were located at the same distance.Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the experimental distances to both shells using a three-point flexible water model which included electrostatic and van der Waals interactions to Mn2+.At 50 K, the structured second shell of the Mn-H radial distribution function is comprised of 18 water molecules, reflecting disorder which becomes dynamically averaged at 300 K as the second shell expands to encompass on average 22 H2O molecules at a mean distance of 5.0 angstrom.The ENDOR and dynamics results support the proposed model of second-shell solvent fluctuation of the Mn2+ ligand field

important in governing their acyl chain order.Knowledge of the nature and magnitude of these interactions is central to understanding the balance of forces present in lipid lamellar phases, which in turn is related to their microscopic and macroscopic behavior.It is possible to explore the contribution of intermolecular interactions using lipid systems with the same headgroup and acyl chain identity by variation of the ratio of the headgroups to acyl chains.In this paper, deuterium (H-2) NMR spectroscopy has been used to gain information on the orientational order of an acyl chain perdeuterated lipid, 1-perdeuterio-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PaLPC-d31), in various molecular environments.The orientational order of PaLPC-d31 was studied in four different lamellar phases, including pure PaLPC-d31 (containing 10 wt % H2O), dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine/PaLPC-d31 (3:1), palmitic acid/PaLPC-d31 (1:1), and cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) (each containing 50 wt % H2O).H-2 NMR spectra were obtained for the low-temperature and liquid-crystalline (L(alpha)) states of each of these mixtures.In the low-temperature state, the first three systems yielded H-2 NMR spectra characteristic of all-trans chains undergoing axial diffusion, with the methyl groups rotating about their C3 axes.The molecular order, as judged by the presence of spectral discontinuities and moment analysis, was found to be almost identical in the low-temperature phases.A different behavior was observed for the cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) sample in that the maximum splitting was close to the all-trans rotating value, with a profile of quadrupolar splittings due to increased disorder near the chain ends.The first three systems underwent order-disorder phase transitions near the same midpoint temperature (range of T(m) values 40-48-degrees-C), whereas the cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) sample did not display a transition over the temperature range studied.In the L(alpha) phase, where order profiles were determined as a function of acyl chain segment position, the segmental ordering differed significantly among the samples.The differences were interpreted using a simple diamond lattice model for the acyl chain configurational statistics, as a means of comparing the effective lengths, <L>, projected along the bilayer normal and estimated chain cross-sectional areas, <A>, of PaLPC-d31 in the various mixtures.The derived values of <L> and <A> can be understood qualitatively in terms of average packing parameters related to the balance of forces in the headgroup and acyl chain regions, or alternatively the curvature free energy of the membrane lipid-water interface.In lamellar phases of pure PaLPC-d31 the curvature stress is potentially large, and interdigitation of the acyl chains of the apposed monolayers may occur.However, in mixtures of PaLPC-d31 with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), the curvature elastic stress is apparently relieved by an increase in the cross-sectional acyl chain area, <A>, i.e. corresponding to an increase in configurational freedom.The data were also compared to the results of statistical theories to yield additional knowledge of the intermolecular forces."}, {"x": 38, "text": "For the H-1 NMR spectrum of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT) in C6D6-D2O, the verv complex H3' signals, which have

estimating crack-strike from the algebraic equivalent of a popular technique, the dual source cumulative technique (DCT), for analysing shear-wave splitting in seismic experiments is evaluated for earth models permeated by different alignments of microcracks.A complementary analysis is performed using another analysis procedure, the dual-independent source-geophone technique (DIT), to investigate any benefits of the alternative formulation.The investigation considers synthetic vertical seismic profile (VSP) and reflection data for an earth model with two layers over a half-space, and three different classes of crack-strike variation with depth: uniform crack-strike, an abrupt change of crack-strike between the upper and lower layer, and a continuous increase over both layers.The synthetic data for zero-offset and near-offset VSPs and a reflection profile are computed using a full-wave modelling package in which equivalent anisotropic media simulate distributions of aligned vertical, parallel, water-filled microcracks.Estimates from the two techniques agree for the constant crack-strike model, but differ for the VSP data with crack-strike changes.The asymptotic behaviour of the two angular parameters theta(G) and theta(S) from DIT suggest that it may be used to determine crack-strike under appropriate circumstances in these VSPs, when the time-delay between the split shear-waves for the layer of interest exceeds the peak period of the wavelet.In this limit, theta(G) tends to follow the crack-strike change with theta(S) tending to a constant value, whereas DCT will give a misleading value between the upper and lower crack-strike.Although the behaviour of DIT is not understood in all cases, theta(G) and theta(S) values from the VSP data always appear to diverge near the point where an abrupt crack-strike change takes place.This could be used as a qualitative indicator for layer stripping.Both techniques agree for the reflection data as the recorded data matrix is necessarily symmetric, but still give misleading results for deeper layers in the presence of crack-strike changes.This study suggests that more care should be taken when designing and analysing experimental configurations for detecting crack properties in reservoir rocks, to consider the response and resolution limits of the analysis techniques.A note of caution is

radicals and the products obtained upon degradation of these radicals (particularly various chloroacetic acids) have been used as markers in these investigations.The results indicated that this chlorine shift, e.g., the rearrangement of CCl3-CH3.--> .CCl2-CH2Cl, occurs much slower (k in the order of 10(6) s-1) at the TiO2 surface than in the homogeneous solution, where the present data confirm earlier rate constants of greater-than-or-equal-to 10(8) s-1.This slowdown of the rearrangement process is attributed to steric hindrance in the surface-adsorbed state of the radicals.In the heterogeneous systems the rearrangement can, on fact, be interfered with by peroxidation of the unrearranged radical in the presence of molecular oxygen while such a competition cannot be achieved in the homogeneous solution even at high O2 concentrations.Experimentally, this has been demonstrated, for example, by the fate of the .CHCl-CCl3 radical generated upon oxidative C-H cleavage from

the monomers about their C3 symmetry axes, and quite unexpectedly, \"umbrella\" inversion tunneling.In the K(a)=0 A + E and E + E states, the measured umbrella inversion tunneling splittings range

stationary fluorescene and time-resolved fluorescence decay in thylakoid membranes and photosystem PS II preparations.Fluorescence is quenched when the pH on the lumen-side of PS II decreases below 5.5.It is likely to involve an one-proton transition (apparent pK = 4.5-4.8) and quenching is accompanied by an inactivation of the photosynthetic oxygen evolution.The overall quenching is due to a decline in the two nanosecond fluorescence decay components (tau = 1.6 ns and 5 ns at pH 6.5), which mainly contribute to the stationary fluorescence in the presence of the reduced acceptor Q(A).Two picosecond components (tau = 30 ps and 500 ps at pH 6.5) are little affected by low pH and the stationary 'F0'-fluorescence (with oxidized Q(A)) remains constant.When artificial e--donors were added at low pH, the fluorescence recovered, suggesting that quenching is caused by inhibition of e- donation from the water-splitting side.There is no indication that the transfer of excitation energy from the antennae to centers or the trapping process itself is disturbed by internal acidification.We propose that, at centers with an inactive donor side, excitation-energy is 'quenched' by charge recombination between Q(A)- and P-680+.Under physiological conditions quenching induced by a high DELTApH may serve to dissipate excess excitation-energy and to keep Q(A) oxidized, even at high

thermoluminescence and oxygen evolution measurements to characterize the process of water oxidation in the IC2 mutant of Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803 from which the psbO gene had been deleted by Mayes et al.(Mayes, S.R., Cook, K.M., Self, S.J., Zhang, Z. and Barber, J. (1991) Biochim.Biophys.Acta 1060, 1-12).The thermoluminescence results show that the extent of charge stabilization in the S2Q(A)-and S2Q(B)- states is reduced in the IC2 mutant to about 25-30% of that observed in the wild-type, suggesting that functional oxygen evolution occurs in a proportion of the psbO-less mutant cells.The stability of the S2Q(A)-, but not that of the S2Q(B)-, charge pair is markedly increased in the mutant.This points to a structural change of the PS II reaction center complex in the absence of the psbO gene product which affects the redox properties of the Q(A) and Q(B) acceptors to a different extent.The flash-induced oscillation of the B thermoluminescence band, arising from the S2Q(B)- and S3Q(B)- charge recombinations, is largely dampened in the mutant.This indicates that the ability of the water-oxidizing complex to reach its higher oxidation states, S3 and S4, is limited when the psbO gene product is absent.In agreement with the thermoluminescence results, flash-induced oxygen evolution shows a decreased yield and largely dampened oscillation pattern in the mutant.These results indicate that although the psbO gene product is not an absolute requirement for water oxidation its absence disturbs the redox cycling of the water-oxidizing complex and retards the formation of its higher S states.The rapid loss of thermoluminescence intensity during strong illumination of the mutated organism confirms its high susceptibility to photoinhibition.This effect is most likely the consequence of the limited rate of electron donation from the psbO-less water-oxidizing complex to the PS II reaction centre where the accumulation of highly oxidizing species may damage their pigment and protein surroundings."}, {"x": 114, "text": "Most of the

between a vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus and potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv Russet Burbank) plants, with a particular focus on the physiological basis for P-induced resistance of roots to infection.Root infection by the VAM fungus Glomus fasciculatum (<Thaxt.sensu Gerdemann> Gerdemann and Trappe) was extensive for plants grown with low abiotic P supply, and plant biomass accumulation was enhanced by the symbiosis.The capacity of excised roots from P-deficient plants to produce ethylene in the presence or absence of exogenous 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) was markedly reduced by VAM infection.This apparent inhibition of ACC oxidase (ACC(ox)) activity was localized to areas containing infected roots, as demonstrated in split-root studies.Furthermore, leachate from VAM roots contained a potent water-soluble inhibitor of ethylene generation from exogenous ACC by nonmycorrhizal (NM) roots.The leachate from VAM-infected roots had a higher concentration of phenolics, relative to that from NM roots.Moreover, the rates of ethylene formation and phenolic concentration in leachates from VAM roots were inversely correlated, suggesting that this inhibitor may be of a phenolic nature.The specific activity of extracellular peroxidase recovered in root leachates was not stimulated by VAM infection, although activity on a fresh weight basis was significantly enhanced, reflecting the fact that VAM roots had higher protein content than NM roots.Polyphenol oxidase activity of roots did not differ between NM and VAM roots.These results characterize the low resistance response of P-deficient plants to VAM infection.When plants were grown with higher abiotic P supply, the relative benefit of the VAM symbiosis to plant growth decreased and root infection was lower.The in vivo ACC(ox) activity was also greater in roots of plants grown on high levels of P compared with those grown on low levels, although the influence of VAM infection was partially to counteract the nutritional effect of P on ACC(ox) activity.Similar to ACC(ox) activity, extracellular peroxidase activity of roots increased linearly with increasing abiotic P supply, thus indicating a greater potential for resistance to VAM infection.These findings suggest that VAM fungi may alter phenolic metabolism of roots so as to hinder ethylene production and the root's ability to invoke a defense response.Raising the abiotic P supply to plants at least partially restores the capacity of roots to produce ethylene and may, in this way, increase the root's resistance to VAM infection."}, {"x": 144, "text": "The charge separation process in sintered colloidal TiO2 film electrodes has been studied by means of action spectra in the UV

5-doxylstearic acid (IV) as spin probes.For radicals I and II the nitrogen hyperfine splitting, a(N), and the rotational correlation time, tau(c), have been analyzed, yielding information about the polarity and viscosity of their locations.At <H2O>/<EO(4)NP> less-than-or-equal-to 0.3, the presence of \"waterless' micellar aggregates in fast exchange (nu(ex) > 10(6) s-1) with the monomer surfactant is evident.At <H2O>/<EO(4)NP> = 0.6, the core viscosity is at its maximum value and the exchange rate decreases below the limit of slow exchange (nu(ex) < 10(6) s-1).Upon further increasing the water content, the core becomes more polar and less viscous, with these parameters approaching their values in bulk water.The effect of Cu(II) ion (in an oil-soluble complex) on the spectra of radical II-confined to the water-pool-has been interpreted by using Leigh's theory, and the \"distance of closest approach\" between these two paramagnetic species has been evaluated.This distance is considered to represent a measure of the penetrability of the micellar shell.Radical IV yielded anisotropic spectra in the aggregates with slow exchange.From their ESR parameters the order degree of the surfactant chains in the micellar shell has been evaluated.All results are consistent, indicating reduced penetrability and increased order with increasing dimensions of the water-pool."}, {"x":

of H2O-Splitting activity <Burnap, R., & Sherman, L.A.(1991) Biochemistry 30, 440-446>.<C-14>DCMU-binding experiments now show that the number and affinity of DCMU-binding sites (normalized to chlorophyll) are equivalent in DELTA-psbO and the wild type, suggesting equal concentrations of assembled reaction centers.A similar conclusion is reached on the basis of measurements of PSII electron transport (DPC-supported DCPIP reduction) by mutant and wild-type thylakoids.The pattern of flash O2 yield by DELTA-psbO cells measured with a bare platinum electrode exhibits a period four oscillation (with a maximum on the third flash), indicating that the H2O-splitting enzyme in DELTA-psbO retains the basic mechanistic features found in normal cells.However, the amplitude of these signals is smaller and more highly damped than those obtained from wild-type cells, suggesting the absence of MSP results in a higher miss probability and/or a reduction in the number of centers competent in oxygen evolution, Analysis of the rise kinetics of the ampermeric signal on the bare platinum electrode indicates that the S3-<S4>-S0 transition is retarded by at least a factor of 5 in the mutant.Thermoluminescence emission peak temperatures indicate that the S2Q(A)-, S2Q(B)-, and S3Q(B)- charge pairs are significantly more stable with respect to recombination in the mutant.The intensities of the thermoluminescence emissions are also significantly reduced in the mutant.Taken together, the data suggest that functional consequences of the genetic removal of MSP are complex.Although the number of photochemically active PSII reaction centers is not much changed by the absence of MSP, the proportion of centers which are coupled to functional O2-evolving enzymes appears to be reduced.For those centers which are effectively coupled to O2 evolution, we find evidence of alterations in the kinetic properties of the enzyme due to the absence of MSP.These are (1) an increased miss factor, (2) a retardation of the S3-<S4>-S0 transition, and (3) an increase in the stabilization of the S2 and S3 states."}, {"x": 156, "text": "The use of ion beam damage to locally

surface recombination rate has been used to derive the band bending in the semiconductor as a function of electrode potential.Extensive Fermi level pinning is observed close to flat band, and this has been related to the formation of adlayers by reduction of soluble arsenic(III) and gallium(III) species.High rates of surface recombination were observed after the electrochemical passivation of

changes and the relaxation of ortho-H-2 to para-H-2 are apparent from variations in the observed spectra with time and temperature.A reasonably detailed interpretation of the complex spectral behavior has been possible through simulation of spectra for H-2 interacting with the surface of amorphous ice clusters generated previously in a classical trajectory study of the cluster growth through the accumulation and relaxation of individual water molecules.Potential minima were calculated with respect to H-2 coordinates on the cluster surface and a qualitative interpretation of adsorbate-surface

dipole and quadrupole.The net binding of H-2 to the surface is dominated by several van der Waals interactions with neighboring D2O molecules, but in most of the calculated minima, H-2 also forms a single electrostatic bond to a surface molecule.While such electrostatic bonds provide only a small fraction of the binding energy, they appear to influence strongly the observed spectra.Observed H-2-induced shifts in the dangling OD bands appear to be caused by electrostatic bonding of H-2 to a D atom of a dangling OD and a significant fraction of the H-2 intensity is proposed to originate from H-2 molecules which are electrostatically bonded to dangling oxygen atoms on the surface.Calculations (which do not contain adjustable parameters) reproduce quite well several features of the

the behavior of the recently developed diffusion equation method (DEM) for water clusters.The DEM is a global optimization method that involves the deformation of the potential energy surface to remove local minima of high energy.The deformed potential energy surface corresponds to the solution F(x,t) of the diffusion equation with the original energy function f(x) as the initial condition, i.e., F(x,0) = f(x).Starting from the few local minima that survived for large values of t (t can be interpreted here as time), consecutive local minimizations are carried out for gradually decreasing times.The trajectories of these time-reversing procedures lead to deep minima at time t = 0.Hopefully, one of them is the global minimum.The interactions between water molecules are more complex than those for argon clusters (Lennard-Jones potential) treated earlier by the DEM.The well-known MCY potential was used here to describe the water pair interactions.The diffusion equation was solved analytically in the space of the Cartesian coordinates of all of the atoms, and then a subset of this space (for which the bond lengths and bond angles of the H2O molecules were fixed) was explored.The DEM was applied to systems containing up to n = 8 water molecules.For n less-than-or-equal-to 5, the method led to the global minima; for n = 8, we obtained a structure insignificantly different in energy and geometry from the global-minimum structure.For n > 5, the method failed to locate the global minima, but in these cases we found a strong indication that the minima given by the DEM are definitely wider than the known global minima.This result is similar to one obtained by Kostrowicki and Scheraga in an application of the DEM to oligopeptides.Keeping in mind the ultimate intended application of the DEM to the global optimization of polypeptides, two general conclusions about the method result from the present work: (i) wider minima have a preference over narrower minima to survive in the deformation process; (ii) the trajectories in the time-reversing procedures may split into two or more branches at some time t, and an improper decision as to which branch to

by a lag phase of 1.2 ms.As the used tobacco lamellar systems have an average diameter of 4-5-mu-m this lag phase is interpreted to be due to an average distance of 2.4-mu-m between oxygen emitting sources and the electrode surface.This interpretation of the lag phase is substantiated by the fact that photosystem I-mediated oxygen uptake in the same preparation measured with the same amperometric technique exhibits the same lag phase although the kinetic uptake parameters are considerably slower than those of oxygen evolution due to the water-splitting reaction.The analysis of the oxygen evolution signal shows that the sedimentation time i.e. the quality of the contact of the source with the electrode is decisive for the measured value for the oxygen release time, which with this method without much effort comes out to be certainly not longer than 1.5 ms.A computer simulation shows that the distance of the oxygen emitting layer from the electrode as well as its thickness and the actual release time are variables which influence practically all parameters (signal shape, amplitude etc.)of such amperometric signals.From this it appears that the determined apparent experimental parameters of oxygen evolution kinetics contain deformations due to the thickness of the sample and the diffusion distance from the electrode.An extrapolation calculated for a sample of infinite thinness separated from the electrode by a minimal distance of 0.001-mu-m with tau of 5.5 ms yields a lower limit value for the half-rise time of 0.5 ms, a value which has been experimentally

complexes C6H6-H2O, C6H6-HDO, C6H6-D2O, C6H6-(H2O)2, and C6H6-(D2O)2.In C6H6-H2O, the lack of an S0-S1 origin transition and the presence of a splitting at 6(0)1 (which is absent in C6H6-HDO) provide vibronic level evidence that the water molecule is on the sixfold axis undergoing internal rotation about that axis.Rotational band contour analysis of the 6(0)1 transitions of the isotopomers confirms this picture and also determines a ground state center-of-mass separation between C6H6 and D2O of 3.32 +/- 0.07 angstrom, very close to that predicted by ab initio calculations.R2PI scans of the van der Waals structure in the isotopic series C6H6-H2O, C6H6-HDO, and C6H6-D2O provide tentative assignments for three of the six van der Waals modes in the complex.In C6H6-(H2O)2, rotational band contour analysis of the origin transition provides a best-fit structure in which the two water molecules reside on the same side of the benzene ring at a H2O-H2O separation close to that in the free water dimer.Qualitatively, the structure of the 1:2 cluster is thus one which maximizes the strength of the water-water hydrogen bond at the expense of a somewhat poorer interaction of the second water molecule with the benzene ring in an off-axis geometry.Several intriguing features of the structure are suggested by our analysis, but are near the limit of our ability to distinguish from band contour fitting.Among these features are (i) the on-axis water molecule is pulled slightly in toward the ring from that in the 1:1 complex; (ii) the water dimer prefers an orientation bisecting a C-C bond in the benzene ring; (iii) the water-water separation is approximately 0.2 angstrom less than that in the free water dimer; and (iv) the water dimer axis is tilted by about 10-degrees relative to the plane of the benzene ring.Finally, the van der Waals structure in C6H6-(H2O)2 and C6H6-(D2O)2 suggests the possibility of large amplitude motion in these complexes as well.We postulate that this

of the geometries of these clusters.Among the spectral clues provided by the data are the frequency shifts of the transitions, their van der Waals structure, the fragmentation of the photoionized clusters, and the complexation-induced origin intensity and 6(0)1 splitting.In the 1:3 cluster, simple arguments are made based on the known structures of the 1:1 and 1:2 clusters which lead to the conclusion that all three water molecules reside on the same side of the benzene ring.Three structures for the 1:3 cluster are proposed which are consistent with the available data.Of these, only one is also consistent with the remarkable similarity of the 1:4 and 1:5 spectra to those of the 1:3 cluster.This structure involves a cyclic water trimer in which one of the water molecules is near the sixfold axis in a pi-hydrogen-bonded configuration.This structure is then expanded in the 1:4 and 1:5 clusters to incorporate the fourth and fifth water molecules in cyclic structures which place the additional water molecules far from the benzene ring without disturbing the interaction of the other water molecules with the benzene ring.For 1:n clusters with n greater-than-or-equal-to 6, subtle and then significant changes are observed in the spectra which indicate changes in the way the water cluster interacts with the benzene ring.This development occurs at precisely the water cluster size which calculations predict that cagelike water cluster structures will begin to compete and eventually be favored over large cyclic structures.Finally, cursory scans of the 2:1 cluster show that this cluster also fragments efficiently upon photoionization by loss of a single water molecule and that it possesses a distinctly asymmetric structure with a sizable 6(0)1 splitting.Two potential structures are proposed for the 2:1 cluster which can both reasonably explain the observations-a BBW structure in which the water molecule (W) is pi-hydrogen bonded to a single benzene molecule (B)

over 70% of the water discharge at high flow stages and 50-60% at low flow stages.As a result, mean velocity, depth, bed shear stress and sediment transport rate tend to be greater here than in the more strongly curved left-hand channel.The loci of maximum flow velocity, depth and bed shear stress are near the centre of the channel upstream of the island, but then split and move towards the outer banks of both channels downstream.Variations in these loci depend on the flow stage.Topographically induced across-stream flows are generally stronger than the weak, curvature-induced secondary circulations.Water surface topography is controlled mainly by centrifugal accelerations and local changes in downstream flow velocity.The averaged water surface slope of the study reach varies very little with discharge, having values between 0.00075 and 0.00090.As bed shear stress generally varies in a similar way to mean velocity, friction coefficients vary little, normally being in the range 0.07-0.13.These values are similar to those in straight channels with sandy dune-covered beds.Bedload is moved mainly as dunes at all flow stages.Grain size is mainly medium sand with coarse sand moved in thalwegs adjacent to the cut banks, and with fine sand at the downstream end of the island.These patterns of flow velocity, depth, water surface topography, bed shear stress, bedload transport rate and mean grain size can be accurately predicted using theoretical models of flow, bed topography and sediment transport rate in single river bends, applied separately to the left and right channels."}, {"x": 443, "text": "Some properties of two different types of natural single crystals of pyrite (FeS2) have been investigated in order to understand their different

first order with the number of coordinated water molecules and the effect of geometry (through the zero-field splitting) is smaller.For this series the magnitude of the relaxivity per coordinated water molecule is approximately a factor of two higher than that per coordinated water molecule in the hexaaquamanganese(II) and MnEDTA(H2O)2- complexes.In contrast, in the series of 15-membered ring

of relaxivity per coordinated water molecule is observed as for the hexaaquamanganese(II) and MnEDTA(H2O)2- complexes.From parameters obtained by fitting the NMRD profiles with the dipolar Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations, it is seen that the effective distance between the metal center and proton nucleus is significantly shortened in cases with ligand unsaturation.Since there is no

ocean surface and sigma = -1 at the ocean bottom.There is no restriction on the form of the parameterizations that can be used for mixing in the temperature, salinity and momentum equations.The most important limitation of the model is the requirement to use a linear parameterization of bottom stress.This can be in terms of either bottom velocity, vertically averaged velocity or bottom geostrophic velocity.The model also lacks information on coastal, baroclinic Kelvin waves.This restricts its use to shelf regions that are wide compared to the internal radius of deformation.Fortunately, many shelf regions (e.g.the Newfoundland/Labrador shelf, the Middle Atlantic Bight, the West Florida shelf and the South Australia shelf) satisfy this requirement.We illustrate the behaviour of the model by describing an experiment showing the development of a shelf-break jet such as the Labrador Current.The model ocean has a uniform depth of 50 m along the western and northern boundaries and has an adjoining shelf and slope region.Initially, the density is everywhere uniform.Lighter water is then flushed in through the northern boundary and allowed to exit through the southern boundary.The inflow water enters the model domain at its shallowest depth, has uniform vertically averaged velocity and has a density which matches the initial value at the eastern boundary and then decreases linearly westwards.As time progresses the flow is increasingly concentrated at the shelf-break.One year into the integration, a well-defined shelf-break jet has developed.At this time, the shelf-break appears as a convergence zone in the bottom level of the model, with offshore Ekman transport on the shelf being opposed by weak upslope flow offshore.Subsequently, the JEBAR term plays a dramatic role in the splitting of the jet, creating a new jet further offshore.After 2000 days, the model exhibits two jets with roughly half the inflow

results are explained considering the processes that take place at the surface of the semiconductor, in which OH radicals have an important role.With respect to the initial charge transfer steps a kinetic analysis has been performed.From this analysis it was deduced that the constant rate of formation of OH radicals is about 4.0 x 10(4) times greater than the constant rate of the direct

transitional community which utilized open water, nearshore, and wetlands (35 species); and a wetlands taxocene, comprised of 4 7 species found to be closely associated with coastal wetlands.The wetland species split into two main groups: permanent residents (e.g., brown bullhead Ictalurus nebulosus, mudminnow Umbra lima, longnose gar Lepisosteus osseus) and migratory species.Migratory species included three subgroups: (1) those that spawned in the wetlands and then left (e.g., northern pike Esox lucius, common carp Cyprinus carpio, white sucker Catostomus commersoni, walleye Stizostedion vitreum), (2) those that used the wetlands as a nursery area (e.g., northern pike, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius), and (3) those that migrated into the wetland from other wetlands or a Great Lake for shelter, spawning sites, or food; as part of the sustaining process of dispersal of young; or as part of wandering behavior (e.g., burbot Lota lota, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss).It was found that most remaining coastal wetlands are degraded or altered to some degree, and are dominated by a characteristic silt- and turbidity-tolerant fish fauna (e.g., common carp, gizzard shad, goldfish Carassius auratus, and brown bullhead).Nevertheless, even degraded wetlands still functioned as important fish habitat by exporting large quantities offish, first to avian, piscine, and mammalian food chains through predation, and second to the Great Lakes as young-of-the-year sport and forage fish.The research implies that a wetland must maintain a connection with a Great Lake to promote and enhance efficient fish utilization of the high productivity of marshes; that additional resilience is provided to species which spawn in wetlands since they can produce two cohorts (one in wetlands and one in the Great Lakes), and that fluctuating water levels are important in sustaining habitat diversity and

atmospheric deposition chemistry.The method is applied for a semi-natural moorland catchment in mid-Wales (Afon Gwy).For both hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium, the modelled stream mixing relationships are non-linear, particularly at low hydrogen ion concentrations.The results also show that the relationship between hydrogen ion and inorganic aluminium concentrations varies with time in the stream.This result has important implications as it implies that aluminium concentrations will not recover, with reduced anthropogenic sulphur deposition, as rapidly as has previously been

promote change.The 1990s seem to offer great possibilities for fuel cell commercialisation.Awareness of environmental problems has never been greater and there is growing belief that fuel cell technology can contribute to solving some of these problems.Issues which have caused the power industry in Europe to re-think its methods of generation include: concern over increasing carbon dioxide emissions and their contribution to the greenhouse effect; increasing SOx and NOx emissions and the damage cause by acid rain; the possibility of adverse effects on health caused by high voltage transmission lines; environmental restrictions to the expansion of hydroelectric schemes; public disenchantment with nuclear power following the Chernobyl accident; avoidance of dependence on imported oil following the Gulf crisis and a desire for fuel flexibility.All these factors are hastening the search for clean, efficient, modular power generators which can be easily sited close to the electricity consumer and operated using a variety of fuels.It is not only the power industry which is changing.A tightening of the legislation concerning emissions from cars is encouraging European auto companies to develop electric vehicles, some of which may be powered by fuel cells.Political changes, such as the opening up of Eastern Europe will also expand the market for low-emission, efficient power plants as attempts are made to develop and clean up that region.Many Europeans organisations are re-awakening their interest, or strengthening their activities, in the area of fuel cells because of the increasing opportunities offered by the European market.While some companies have chosen to buy, test and demonstrate Japanese or American fuel cell stacks with the aim of gaining operational experience and developing European sub-systems, others have chosen to develop their own novel cell technology.This paper will survey the extent of the fuel cell activities in Europe and emphasise the particular markets which fuel cell manufacturers are targeting.Demand for fuel cells in defence and military applications will be the first sector to be commercially viable - European companies such as Siemens, Elenco and VSEL are already marketing AFC or PEM systems for naval and aerospace applications.The small-scale CHP sector is also a likely early market for fuel cell plant.Co-generation fuel cells are of great interest to gas companies like ENAGAS and British Gas looking to promote sales of gas by installing on-site gas-fired generators on their customers' premises.The market for utility scale fuel cell plants is expected to develop later in the decade.The largest demonstration planned for Europe is the 1 MW PAFC for Milan, due to come on-stream in 1992.MBB GmbH is considering developing MW-scale MCFC plants with the US company ERC - a 2 MW demonstration is planned for the end of 1993.The potential market for utility fuel cells is large - installation rates could reach 500-1000 MW/year by the turn of the century.Fuel cells will probably not achieve significant use in transport applications in Europe until after the turn of the century

hybrids, six soil N levels, and two water regimes (irrigated and nonirrigated) was conducted at Mead, NE, on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam soil (fine montmorillinitic, mesic Typic Arguidoll).In the low

to 235 lb/acre soil N levels.Increasing soil N level decreased KBS of all hybrids, but hybrid response was inconsistent across WR and years.In 1988, irrigation resulted in denser kernels by 0.0400 to 0.0475 g/ml, except for hybrid 442, whose KD was only 0.0273 g/ml greater.In 1987, GP of hybrids 442, 629, 692, 212, and 488 increased linearly as soil N levels increased while the GP of hybrid 688 peaked at the 235 lb/acre soil N level.In 1988, GP of hybrid 688 was similar across WR while all other hybrids had 1.9 to 2.5% higher GP on nonirrigated plots.In 1987 and on irrigated plots in 1988, NUE differences were greater at soil N levels below 85 lb/acre with hybrid 442 having the highest NUE.Producers considering use of low fertilizer N rates must recognize importance of corn hybrid selection for high grain yield and NUE, and that low N levels reduce grain quality as measured by KBS, KD, and GP."}, {"x": 495, "text": "Growth, fruiting, and mineral nutrition of trickle- or

is possible to explore the contribution of intermolecular interactions using lipid systems with the same headgroup and acyl chain identity by variation of the ratio of the headgroups to acyl chains.In this paper, deuterium (H-2) NMR spectroscopy has been used to gain information on the orientational order of an acyl chain perdeuterated lipid, 1-perdeuterio-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PaLPC-d31), in various molecular environments.The orientational order of PaLPC-d31 was studied in four different lamellar phases, including pure PaLPC-d31 (containing 10 wt % H2O), dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine/PaLPC-d31 (3:1), palmitic acid/PaLPC-d31 (1:1), and cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) (each containing 50 wt % H2O).H-2 NMR spectra were obtained for the low-temperature and liquid-crystalline (L(alpha)) states of each of these mixtures.In the low-temperature state, the first three systems yielded H-2 NMR spectra characteristic of all-trans chains undergoing axial diffusion, with the methyl groups rotating about their C3 axes.The molecular order, as judged by the presence of spectral discontinuities and moment analysis, was found to be almost identical in the low-temperature phases.A different behavior was observed for the cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) sample in that the maximum splitting was close to the all-trans rotating value, with a profile of quadrupolar splittings due to increased disorder near the chain ends.The first three systems underwent order-disorder phase transitions near the same midpoint temperature (range of T(m) values 40-48-degrees-C), whereas the cholesterol/PaLPC-d31 (1:1) sample did not display a transition over the temperature range studied.In the L(alpha) phase, where order profiles were determined as a function of acyl chain segment position, the segmental ordering differed significantly among the samples.The differences were interpreted using a simple diamond lattice model for the acyl chain configurational statistics, as a means of comparing the effective lengths, <L>, projected along the bilayer normal and estimated chain cross-sectional areas, <A>, of PaLPC-d31 in the various

ammonia dimer.Our data are analyzed in combination with all previously measured far-infrared and microwave spectra for this cluster.The vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) states of the ammonia dimer connected by electric-dipole-allowed transitions are separated into three groups that correspond to different combinations of monomer rotational states: A + A states (states formed from the combination of two ammonia monomers in A states), A + E states, and E + E states.We present complete experimentally determined energy-level diagrams for the K(a)=0 and K(a)=1 levels of each group in the ground vibrational state of this complex.From these, we deduce that the appropriate molecular symmetry group for the ammonia dimer is G144.This, in turn, implies that three kinds of tunneling motions are feasible for the ammonia dimer: interchange of the \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" roles of the monomers, internal rotation of the monomers about their C3 symmetry axes, and quite unexpectedly, \"umbrella\" inversion tunneling.In the K(a)=0 A + E and E + E states, the measured umbrella inversion tunneling splittings range from 1.1 to 3.3 GHz.In K(a)=1, these inversion splittings between two sets of E + E states are 48 and 9 MHz, while all others are completely quenched.Another surprise, in light of previous analyses of tunneling in the ammonia dimer, is our discovery that the interchange tunneling splittings are large.In the A + A and E + E states, they are 16.1 and 19.3 cm-1, respectively.In the A + E states, the measured 20.5 cm-1 splitting can result from a difference in \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" internal rotation frequencies that is increased by interchange tunneling.We rule out the possibility that the upper state of the observed far-infrared subbands is the

values of the specific enthalpy and specific entropy of unfolding both converge to common values at approximately the same temperature (T(h)* congruent-to T(s)*) when extrapolated linearly versus temperature?In 1986, a liquid hydrocarbon model gave an explanation for convergence of the specific entropies at T(s)*: it happens because the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to the entropy of unfolding goes to zero at T(s)*.The reason for convergence of the specific enthalpies at T(h)* and for the equality T(h)* congruent-to T(s)* has remained, however, a matter for speculation; recently, some explanations have been given that are based on models for polar interactions in protein folding.We show here that the relation T(h)* congruent-to T(s)* can be derived straightforwardly without making any assumptions either about polar interactions or about splitting the hydrophobic interaction into two terms-one for the \"hydrophobic hydration\" and the other for the residual effect, as

the deformation of the potential energy surface to remove local minima of high energy.The deformed potential energy surface corresponds to the solution F(x,t) of the diffusion equation with the original energy function f(x) as the initial condition, i.e., F(x,0) = f(x).Starting from the few local minima that survived for large values of t (t can be interpreted here as time), consecutive local minimizations are carried out for gradually decreasing times.The trajectories of these time-reversing procedures lead to deep minima at time t = 0.Hopefully, one of them is the global minimum.The interactions between water molecules are more complex than those for argon clusters (Lennard-Jones potential) treated earlier by the DEM.The well-known MCY potential was used here to describe the water pair interactions.The diffusion equation was solved analytically in the space of the Cartesian coordinates of all of the atoms, and then a subset of this space (for which the bond lengths and bond angles of the H2O molecules were fixed) was explored.The DEM was applied to systems containing up to n = 8 water molecules.For n less-than-or-equal-to 5, the method led to the global minima; for n = 8, we obtained a structure insignificantly different in energy and geometry from the global-minimum structure.For n > 5, the method failed to locate the global minima, but in these

application of the DEM to oligopeptides.Keeping in mind the ultimate intended application of the DEM to the global optimization of polypeptides, two general conclusions about the method result from the present work: (i) wider minima have a preference over narrower minima to survive in the deformation process; (ii) the trajectories in the time-reversing procedures may split into two or more

argon and in the presence of electron scavengers (O2 and N2O) are interpreted on the basis of photoionization as the dominant process for decomposition and a proposed reaction scheme.The efficiencies

membrane preparations of tobacco, sedimented on a large surface electrode, shows that the oxygen signal is preceeded by a lag phase of 1.2 ms.As the used tobacco lamellar systems have an average diameter of 4-5-mu-m this lag phase is interpreted to be due to an average distance of 2.4-mu-m between oxygen emitting sources and the electrode surface.This interpretation of the lag phase is substantiated by the fact that photosystem I-mediated oxygen uptake in the same preparation measured with the same amperometric technique exhibits the same lag phase although the kinetic uptake parameters are considerably slower than those of oxygen evolution due to the water-splitting reaction.The analysis of the oxygen evolution signal shows that the sedimentation time i.e. the quality of the contact of the source with the electrode is decisive for the measured value for the oxygen release time, which with this method without much effort comes out to be certainly not longer than 1.5 ms.A computer simulation shows that the distance of the oxygen emitting layer from the electrode as well as its thickness and the actual release time are variables which influence practically all parameters (signal shape, amplitude etc.)of such amperometric signals.From this it appears that the determined apparent experimental parameters of oxygen evolution kinetics contain deformations due to the thickness of the sample and the diffusion distance from the electrode.An extrapolation calculated for a sample of infinite thinness separated from the electrode by a minimal distance of 0.001-mu-m

time-of-flight mass spectroscopy is used to record S0-S1 spectra of the neutral complexes C6H6-(H2O)n with n = 3-8 and (C6H6)2-(H2O)1,2.Due to limitations imposed by the size of these clusters, a number of vibronic level arguments are used to constrain the gross features of the geometries of these clusters.Among the spectral clues provided by the data are the frequency shifts of the transitions, their van der Waals structure, the fragmentation of the photoionized clusters, and the complexation-induced origin intensity and 6(0)1 splitting.In the 1:3 cluster, simple arguments are made based on the known structures of the 1:1 and 1:2 clusters which lead to the conclusion that all three water molecules reside on the same side of the benzene ring.Three structures for the 1:3 cluster are proposed which are consistent with the available data.Of these, only one is also consistent with the remarkable similarity of the 1:4 and 1:5 spectra to those of the 1:3 cluster.This structure involves a cyclic water trimer in which one of the water molecules is near the sixfold axis in a pi-hydrogen-bonded configuration.This structure is then expanded in the 1:4 and 1:5 clusters to incorporate the fourth and fifth water molecules in cyclic structures which place the additional water molecules far from the benzene ring without disturbing the interaction of the other water molecules with the benzene ring.For 1:n clusters with n greater-than-or-equal-to 6, subtle and then significant changes are observed in the spectra which indicate changes in the way the water cluster interacts with the benzene ring.This development occurs at precisely the water cluster size which calculations predict that cagelike water cluster structures will begin to compete and eventually be favored over large cyclic structures.Finally, cursory scans of the 2:1 cluster show that this cluster also fragments efficiently upon photoionization by loss of a single water molecule and that it possesses a distinctly asymmetric structure with a sizable 6(0)1 splitting.Two potential structures are proposed for the 2:1 cluster which can both reasonably explain the observations-a BBW structure

(ClAlPc) films have been sublimed on conducting SnO2 substrates and have been structurally modified by a 12 h immersion in aqueous solutions at pH 3 containing various salts.Only two types of structural modifications resulting from anion uptake into the ClAlPc film have been observed for the entire range of salts used.They have been labeled transformations I and H according to the changes in the Q band absorbance of the modified Pc.The as-sublimed ClAlPc is characterized by a Q band with a maximum absorbance at about 735 nm.Modifications of the I-type display a Q band characterized by the growth of a peak at 835 +/- 8 nm, while the Q band after H-type transformations shows two maxima at 638 +/- 11 and 805 +/- 6 nm.The photoelectrochemical activity of ClAlPc films have been measured with I-3-/I- before and after transformations.Much variation has been observed from one salt to another.Under white light illumination (35 mW cm-2), as-sublimed films are characterized by short-circuit photocurrents of 0.25 to 0.30 mA cm-2, while after modifications, J(sc) ranges from 0.10 to 1.0 mA cm-2.For I-type transformations, the highest J(sc) values (0.80 to 0.85 mA cm-2) have

the structural reorganization of the crystallites resulting from the uptake of anions in the film, are thought to be responsible for the photoactivity improvement.For H-type transformations, the highest J(sc) values (0.8 to 1.0 mA cm-2) have been obtained with KCl, KBr, or KClO3.For these salts, the structural reorganization of the crystallites goes along with a drastic change in the film morphology as observed by SEM.The long axis of the ClAlPc crystallites, perpendicular to the substrate for the as-sublimed film, changes its orientation by 90-degrees to become parallel to the substrate after transformation.The kinetics of this process is very fast, with more than 50% completion of modification after 1 min in contact with the solution.This change in orientation is not observed when an H-type transformation is induced on ClAlPc films by solutions of salts leading to low photoactivities.From the comparison between absorption and action spectra, it seems that H-type

NMR longitudinal relaxation rate (NMRD profile) has been studied for eight Mn2+ macrocyclic complexes.In one series of four complexes, the macrocyclic ring includes pyridine, two imines, and two or three amines, and its size is increased from 15 to 18 members.In a second series of complexes having 15-membered rings and five nitrogen donor atoms, the degree of saturation in the macrocyclic ring is varied.An additional complex is made coordinatively saturated by addition of two ethylamino pendant arms that fill the axial sites.The complexes were all isolated as halide salts and were characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectra, magnetic moments, and conductivities.EPR spectra of frozen aqueous/glycerol solutions are consistent with the number of coordinated water molecules varying between zero and two.The NMRD profiles show that, in the series in which the ring size is varied, the relaxivity is correlated to first order with the number of coordinated water molecules and the effect of geometry (through the zero-field splitting) is smaller.For this series the magnitude of the relaxivity per coordinated water molecule is approximately a factor of two higher than that per coordinated water molecule in the hexaaquamanganese(II) and MnEDTA(H2O)2- complexes.In contrast, in the series of 15-membered ring complexes in which the degree of saturation is varied, relaxivity
