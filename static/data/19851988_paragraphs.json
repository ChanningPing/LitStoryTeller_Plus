as a quenching of PS II fluorescence during the photoactivation.A relative fluorescence increase around 672 nm also occurred during the same period and is thought to reflect rapid light-induced chlorophyll formation.The flashed leaves contained small amounts of photoactive photochlorophyllide which could be removed by a short flash of intense white light given before continuous

by an inhibition of electron donation from the manganese cluster to the reaction centre of PS 2.The pH response of quenching suggested that a 1 H+-transition with an apparent pK of 4.7 was involved.Parallel to quenching at low pH, a Ca2+-release was measured (1 Ca2+ per 200 Chl).When the DELTApH relaxed and the pH on the lumen side increased again, fluorescence recovered provided Ca2+

that at high DELTApH (1) the water splitting side is inactivated by release of Ca from a high affinity binding site, and (2) Q(A) is converted to a high-potential form.Excitation energy is then

showing that the reaction center is not touched by the reagent.The influence of the chemical is characterized by the fact that at basic pH (7.5-8.5) the deactivation mode of S2 and S3 is changed, showing that the cyanide-ion is the reactant.Whereas in the control the deactivation of S2 yields as usual S1 and S-1, the deactivation pattern in the presence of cyanide shows that S2 deactivates - without giving S1 -, to a more reduced state, probably S0.In the flash pattern the two signal amplitudes of the first two flashes are lowered to zero in the presence of 2 x 10(-6) M cyanide and become uptake signals at higher cyanide concentrations.It is seen that in the presence of cyanide S2 and to a lesser extent S3 in the Oscillatoria system apparently react with oxygen.In tobacco thylakoids no effect of cyanide on the flash pattern itself is observed, even at higher concentrations (e.g.10(-4) M), although the signal amplitudes of the entire pattern are affected at such

on the characteristics of high-amplitude stress wave propagation in a low-porosity (0.8-1.0%) brittle rock under well-controlled laboratory conditions.A unique porosity enhancement technique, using a gas fracturing process, was developed to provide a controlled, homogeneous, isotropic increase in porosity to 2.4-2.9% (a factor of 2.5-3.5) in Sierra White granite.Combined with a technique to independently control confining and pore pressures, the experiments provided measured radial particle velocities, calculated displacements, and peak velocity and displacement attenuations.In the experiments, key parametric effects due to fracture-induced porosity increase combined with pore water content were observed.In particular, a significant porosity (and accompanying fracture) increase combined with fully saturated, undrained condition (no effective stress) resulted in a substantial decrease in peak velocities and increased pulse durations, leading to greatly increased particle displacements.Reducing the pore pressure in enhanced-porosity rock produces substantially smaller displacements because of narrower pulses.It was concluded that in the region where deviatoric response

originate from the water-splitting site.However, the increased rates of peroxide formation do not quantitatively match the losses in O-2 evolution activity.We suggest that a rapid consumption of the peroxide takes place via a catalase/peroxidase activity at the water-splitting site which competes with both the O-2 evolution and peroxide formation reactions.The observed peroxide formation is

high growth rates and tolerance to varying environmental conditions, and because the oils (lipids) they produce can be extracted and converted to substitute petroleum fuels.Projected global climate change provides a second important rationale for this approach.Climate change has been linked to the accumulation of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.The burning of fossil fuels in power plants is the primary contributor to excess carbon dioxide.Inasmuch as the primary nutrient for microalgal growth is carbon dioxide, operation of microalgal biomass farms has emerged as a promising candidate in the search for alternative approaches to ameliorate global climate change.The production of diesel fuel by microalgae requires very large quantities of carbon dioxide as a nutrient.In areas where microalgae fuel farms operate in tandem with fossil fuel plants to scrub carbon dioxide from flue gases, the release of carbon dioxide could be significantly reduced.If the microalgae are used to produce fuel, a mass culture facility reduces by approximately 50% the carbon dioxide emissions from the power plant per million Btu delivered.For example, although coal is ordinarily considered to be the most polluting fossil fuel on the basis of carbon dioxide emitted per amount of energy produced, the incorporation of microalgal ponds with a coal-fired plant would make this fossil fuel less polluting than existing oil- and natural-gas-fired plants.Similar advantages can be achieved for oil- and gas-fired plants.If commodity chemicals are produced from algae instead of fuels, the net carbon dioxide reduction is significantly greater.Commodity chemicals can be used to produce goods with long-term uses such as building materials.Such uses would result in the sequestering of carbon

this, simulations of channels 4 and 5 of AVHRR/2 of NOAA-11 using a radiative transfer model have been made.The range of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures introduced in the simulation

non-fossil-fuel energy sources for production of electricity and fuels.Nuclear fusion can probably pro vide much of the required energy economically, if large single-unit power plants are acceptable.Large power plants are more common than most people realize: There are already many multiple-unit power plants producing 2 to 5 GW(electric) at a single site.The cost of electricity (COE) from fusion energy is predicted to scale as COE almost-equal-to COE0(P/P0)-n, where P is the electrical power, the subscript zero denotes reference values, and the exponent n almost-equal-to 0.36 to 0.7 in various designs.The validity ranges of these scalings are limited and need to be extended by future work.The fusion power economy of scale derives from four interrelated effects: improved operations and maintenance costs, scaling of equipment unit costs; a geometric effect that increases the mass power density; and reduction of the recirculating power fraction.Increased plasma size also relaxes the required confinement parameters: For the same neutron wall loading, larger tokamaks can use lower magnetic fields.Fossil-fuel power plants have a weaker economy of scale than fusion because the fuel costs constitute much of their COE.Solar and wind power plants consist of many small units, so they have little economy of scale.Fission power plants have a strong economy of scale but are unable to exploit it because the maximum unit size is limited by safety concerns.Large, steady-state fusion reactors generating 3 to 6 GW(electric) may be able to produce electricity for 4 to

phase diagram has earlier been established, which is often used in experimental studies of phase transitions.While the two diagrams are qualitatively similar, there are quantitative differences.Substituting H2O for D2O lowers both T(NI) and T(NL) at corresponding concentrations: at phi = 0.15, T(NI)(D2O) - T(NI)(H2O) is 3.9 K and T(NL)(D2O) - T(NL)(H2O) is 4.3 K; these differences decrease-with-increasing phi (temperature) and eventually vanish at phi almost-equal-to 0.41 (80-degrees-C).This behavior arises from differences in micelle size: the micelles are a little larger in D2O than in H2O at corresponding concentrations and temperatures below 80-degrees-C.This ''isotope effect'' on micelle size is attributed to tighter binding of Cs+ to surface carboxylate groups via bridging water molecules in the case of D2O.The cmc's occur at higher concentrations in D2O, in contrast to the behavior of the sodium alkyl sulfates and alkyltrimethylammonium bromides

n-GaAs photoanodes displayed different open circuit voltages in contact with each electrolyte solution investigated.The role of the chemisorbed metal in  the n-GaAs/M/KOH-Se-/2-(aq) system is, therefore, best described as catalyzing interfacial charge transfer at the semiconductor/liquid interface, as opposed to establishing a semiconductor/metal or semiconductor/insulator/metal contact

for effects of the lysimeter tanks, six additional trees (three on each rootstock) were transplanted directly into soil without tanks and were also irrigated with the lowest salinity water.All trees were fertilized at recommended rates in 50 split applications per year.A similar tank with no tree was also fertilized and irrigated with the lowest salinity water to determine nutrient recovery from soils without roots.During the second year, up to 70% of the applied N and up to 80% of the applied K was recovered in the drainage water from this blank tank with no tree.At the end of the study, trees outside the tanks were smaller but were nutritionally similar to the low salinity trees in lysimeters.Trees on CC were larger, tended to have greater root densities, higher evapotranspiration (ET) and were associated with less leaching of ions and nutrients into drainage water from the tanks than trees on SO.High salinity irrigation water reduced canopy growth and ET but increased total fibrous root dry weight.Trees on CC accumulated more CI in leaves and in fruit juice than those on SO.Overall, leaching loss of total N varied from 2 to 8% of that annually applied.Salinized trees tended to lose more N and up to twice as much K to drainage water as non-salinized trees.Based on differences between N recovered from the blank tank and tanks with trees during the second year, N uptake efficiency was as high as 68% for non-salinized trees and 64% for salinized trees."}, {"x": 244, "text": "The analytic and spectroscopic potential of a new, reflection mode photopyroelectric

both renal arteries for servo-control of renal perfusion pressure at different levels; the urinary bladder was split for determination of renal clearances and electrolyte excretion from each kidney separately.Because both kidneys were exposed to the same neurohumoral influences, any changes in renal function could be attributed to differences in renal perfusion pressure between the two kidneys.After 5 days of control, renal perfusion pressure to one kidney was reduced from 86.7+/-0.2 to 74.2+/-0.6 mm Hg for 12 days, and pressure in the contralateral kidney increased to 91.5+/-0.4 mm Hg.Sodium excretion decreased from 41+/-2 to 25+/-1 mmol/d in the servo-controlled kidney and increased from 41+/-1 to 55+/-1 mmol/d in the contralateral kidney during 12 days of servo-control.Urine

warming trend has been predicted by the model, 0.15-degrees-C, during the 1980-1990 period alone.The model predicts that by the year 2060 the SO2 cooling reduces climate warming by 0.5-degrees-C or 25% for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) business as usual (BAU) scenario and 0.2-degrees-C or 20% for scenario D (for a slow pace of fossil fuel burning).The hypothesis is

Stefan Institute is summarized and illustrated by some new selected results.To study the interactions of radon and its daughters with solid surfaces a new method was developed and applied for the measurement of the deposition rate of radon daughters on different materials.The method is based on a combination of a high-sensitivity (10 kBq m-3) autoradiographic technique, which enables localization of a single atom adsorbed on a solid surface and a high resolution digital spectroscopic technique, which enables discernment among background, radon alpha particle, and polonium alpha particle tracks.To increase the sensitivity of passive methods for radon measurements a new dosimeter based on a combination of charcoal (which collects radon from the air) and the CR-39 detector (which simultaneously registers alpha particles) was designed.Its sensitivity (20 Bq m-3) for short exposure time (3 h) was found to be two orders of magnitude higher in comparison with theoretically attainable standard etched track dosimeters.An etched track radon dosimeter is widely used for indoor and outdoor radon survey monitoring.An average radon concentration in Slovenian homes was found to

estimate the flux of solar neutrinos from the amounts of Pb-205 isotope in the ore induced by Tl-205 (nu, e-) Pb-205 reaction.A good knowledge of the thermal neutron flux is needed to evaluate the rate of the contribution to background events through the neutron capture reaction Pb-204 (n, gamma) Pb-205.In the frame of this project thermal neutron flux and radon concentration are measured by a

mathematical simulation.The analysis of the time- and spatially resolved potential, hole and electron density profiles suggests (1) that the occurrence and the shape of the maximum are due to the photocurrent and (2) that it depends on the ratio of the surface recombination and the photocurrent.In the high injection region (p(i) > n0) quadratic recombination dominates the decay kinetics and

CdS semiconductor layer.At 0.1 M sulfide, sulfur (predominantly S8) was detected via its Raman signature as a CdS photocorrosion product.The evolution of the Raman bands (attributable to these species

"text": "A method for predicting splittings and shifts of bands in infrared spectra of small clusters of polyatomic molecules is presented.Based on an approach of early publications of Buckingham, the influence of the intermolecular forces on the vibrational energy levels of the constituent molecules is calculated using perturbation theory to second order.In order to describe the interaction of identical molecules, this ansatz is extended to also cover degenerate systems.In first order, a coupling of the vibrational modes of the interacting molecules occurs which leads to delocalized vibrations of all the molecules in the cluster.The second order correction of the vibrational excitation frequencies are found to be dominated by the intramolecular couplings Of the normal modes due to the cubic anharmonicity-of the force field.The procedures developed here are applied for the interpretation of vibrational photodissociation spectra of small methanol clusters in the region of the fundamental excitation frequency of the OH stretching mode (nu1, 3681.5 cm-1), the CH3 rocking mode (nu7, 1074.5 cm-1), and the CO stretching mode (nu8, 1033.5 cm-1).Using semiempirical models for the intermolecular potential functions, splittings and positions of the experimental bands can well be explained.The nonequivalent positions of the two molecules in the linear dimer structure give rise to two different absorption frequencies for each of the three modes of the donor and the acceptor molecule, respectively.The trimer and tetramer spectrum with only one absorption band are in agreement with the existence of symmetric planar ring structures (C3h and C4h) for these species.The pentamer spectrum which also consists of one band is explained by the occurrence of three closely spaced frequencies of an asymmetric ring.The double peak structure in the hexamer spectra can be attributed to a distorted ring structure of S6 symmetry, while the occurrence of other energetically near-degenerate isomers can be ruled out by means of their spectra."}, {"x": 279, "text": "In order to obtain some insight into the interaction between the electronic structure and ionic defects in passivating oxide films, photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to explore passive films formed on tungsten in phosphoric acid.The photoelectrochemical impedance could be measured at low frequencies and at photon energies of up to 5.5 eV using either square-wave-modulated irradiation or step-function excitation.Three different procedures were employed to demonstrate that the system's photocurrent response fulfilled the requirements (linearity, causality, stability and finity) necessary for impedance spectroscopy.Along with photoelectrochemical impedance spectra of passive tungsten in phosphoric acid, photocurrent transients, the electrochemical impedance and transient capacitance and reflectance responses were measured.Photocurrent transients show a fast exponential decay during the first 2 s and a linear increase for the following 10-20 s. Equivalent circuits could be derived to model this behavior.The properties of the first atomic layer of the oxide next to the solution seem to be responsible for the observed effects, which we

general northward flow along the western trough of the Atlantic, Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) must pass over several sills separating the various abyssal basins.At the equator, the western trough is deformed by major east-west offsets of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the continental margin of Brazil, forming a nearly zonal abyssal channel about 250 km wide, centered at the equator, and extending approximately 1000 km along its axis, in which the AABW is confined.Thus, the general northward flow of AABW is topographically constrained to be westward as it crosses the equator.A hydrographic section across this channel at 37-degrees-W shows the AABW isopycnals to be ''bowl'' shaped within and beneath the level of the channel walls.The equatorial geostrophic relation permits us to compute

estimated for the westward-and ultimately northward-transport of AABW.Although this value exceeds previous estimates of net northward transport in the Brazil and Guiana basins made from International Geophysical Year data of the late 1950s, it fits well into an overall scenario constructed from transport estimates made from section data collected during the 1980s.This scenario includes a flow of approximately 7 x 10(6) m3 s-1 of AABW into the Brazil Basin from the south.The magnitude of the northward flow diminishes as it moves toward the equator indicated by estimates of 6.7 x 10(6) m3 s-1

slowly; thus there was little evidence of nutrient translocation by the mycorrhizal fungus from the nutrient to the non-nutrient side in the absence of carbohydrates.Mycorrhizal infection is discussed as a mechanism for heterotrophic carbon assimilation.In advanced leafy orchids of Cattleya, external carbon resulted in increased root growth, decreased shoot/root ratio and sometimes yellowish-green

spectroscopy enables one to study both equilibrium and dynamical properties of membrane constituents at the molecular level and can yield significant insights regarding the organization of non-bilayer lipid aggregates.We have investigated a representative unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine, viz., 1-perdeuteriopalmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, PLPE-d31, in the lamellar, or L(alpha), phase and the reversed hexagonal, or H(II), phase.Phosphorus-31 (P-31) NMR studies of PLPE-d31 in the H(II) phase revealed that the chemical shift anisotropy of the phosphoethanolamine head groups, DELTAsigma was scaled by the expected geometrical factor of -1/2 relative to the lamellar state.However, we found the occurrence of a further reduction in the H-2 NMR quadrupolar splittings, DELTAnu(Q), of the H-2-Labeled palmitoyl acyl chain segments.These observations point toward the role of interfacial curvature with regard to properties of reverse hexagonal phase lipids, and indicate that the pivotal position or neutral surface of approximately constant area may lie near the glycerol or polar head group region.Variations in the acyl chain packing due to curvature of the aqueous interface yield significant differences in the segmental order profiles as determined by H-2 NMR spectroscopy.The latter reflect the local orientational order of the acyl chains and can be used together with simple statistical theories to extract positional or structural information.Average projected acyl chain lengths and mean interfacial or cross-sectional areas for PLPE-d31 in the different phases have been calculated.In addition, we describe a new means of estimating the radius of curvature of H(II) phase lipid aggregates utilizing H-2 NMR spectroscopy, which is based on the difference between the lamellar and hexagonal phase order profiles.Here the radius of curvature, R(c), is defined as the distance from the center of the water core to the lipid/water interface, near the carbonyl segments of the acyl chains, giving R(c) = 25.4-28.1 angstrom for PLPE-d31 in the H(II), phase at 60-degrees-C.This value is in good agreement with previous X-ray diffraction studies of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE).Alternatively, the data yield for the radius of the central water core that R(w) = 17.8-20.5 angstrom at 60-degrees-C.The differences in geometry also lead to higher quadrupolar echo relaxation rates (R2e) for the lipid acyl segments closest to the aqueous interface in the H(II) versus the L(alpha) phase.We propose that this enhancement is due to an additional relaxation mechanism found in the hexagonal phases, namely, translational diffusion of lipids about the cylinder axes.For comparison, the normal hexagonal (H(I)) and lamellar (L(alpha)) phases of a lyotropic system comprising perdeuterated potassium laurate were also studied.This research indicates clearly that the packing and dynamical properties of the acyl chains of phospholipids depend on the curvature of the aqueous interface and, thus, the aggregate geometry.The latter is related to the average shape of lipids in their respective phases and to the curvature free energy, which in the planar state may influence protein-mediated functions of membranes."}, {"x": 314, "text": "The electrical impedance and the optoelectrical impedance due to electron-hole

comparatively high gauche probability.Then the distance from the head group to the methyl terminal is close to that of the C8OO chain, which is almost fully extended.This reflects the flatness of the

pi-pi aggregates in the ML environments.Also, small frequency shifts observed between glass- and water-supported ML samples for modes localized at the periphery of the porphyrin macrocycle indicate the presence of measurable effects due to the nature of the substrate.The most compelling evidence for exciton interactions is observed in the intensity enhancement patterns of the various modes as observed for the glass-supported ML.The Raman excitation spectra (RES) of totally symmetric porphyrin modes show clear evidence of enhancement via both components of the split B state and can be

the onset of rapid long axis rotation at the pretransition of bilayers in water was absent in the presence of glycerol.Effective correlation times for long axis rotation recorded by the 5-position

microspectrophotometry of transverse sections of thin cell walls, there exist problems in that the adjacent cell walls are often measured by non-parallel illumination even with the use of a very small

(Japanese oak, Quercus mongolica FISCHER var.grosseserrata REHD.et WILS.), which possesses various types of cells from the water conducting tissue to the mechanical supporting one.The distributions of

ligands are located at alternating vertices of a cube, with either alcohol or alkoxide and beta-diketonate or benzoate ligands on the exterior of the core.Complexes 1, 2, and 4 were synthesized in a single, high-yield step from MCl2, the beta-diketone, and 2 equiv of the appropriate lithium alkoxide, whereas 3 was isolated upon the slow oxidation by dioxygen of FeCl2 in the presence of methoxide and benzoate.Complexes 1, 2, and 4 have all divalent metal ions, whereas cube 3 is a mixed-valent complex, with one iron(III) site.The terminal methanol coordinated to the ferric ion in 3 is

exercise in model interpolation.A stronger test of model structure would force the model to extrapolate beyond the range of conditions encountered in the calibration record.One way to achieve this is to select a catchment which undergoes a major land use change during the independent test period.The small-scale experiments of forest hydrology are particularly important in this regard because they typically provide high-quality data on the effects of radical land use changes.This study illustrates application of this modified split-sample approach for the Crotty Creek experimental catchment which underwent a 6 year strip thinning treatment that removed 42% of its forest cover.Two lumped catchment models, the SDI and CATPRO models, were compared.To make use of the full rainfall and streamflow record it was necessary to modify these models to differentiate between the interception and evapotranspiration fluxes of the forest and the scrub communities which developed in the cleared strips.Both models were calibrated to the pre-treatment record during which there was 100% forest cover.Only the scrub parameters were calibrated to the post-treatment record.It was found that the SDI model, even though it had been previously extensively tested, failed to predict adequately the high monthly flows that followed the strip thinning treatment, whereas the CATPRO model, using a different conceptualization of quickflow, provided a reasonably good description of monthly water yields before and after the strip thinning treatment.", "rank": 145, "paragraph_comparative_number":

B+tinidazole, 4.9 (1-6) mug; kanamycin, 31.0 (4.7) mug; clindamycin 40.9 (5.5) mug; p<0.001).By contrast with PABA-UDCA, PABA-UDCA disulphate was not actively absorbed from any part of the small

equator, the western trough is deformed by major east-west offsets of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the continental margin of Brazil, forming a nearly zonal abyssal channel about 250 km wide, centered at the equator, and extending approximately 1000 km along its axis, in which the AABW is confined.Thus, the general northward flow of AABW is topographically constrained to be westward as it crosses the equator.A hydrographic section across this channel at 37-degrees-W shows the AABW isopycnals to be ''bowl'' shaped within and beneath the level of the channel walls.The equatorial geostrophic relation permits us to compute a zonal velocity from the well-defined parabolic distribution of dynamic height, relative to a reference level at the transition between AABW and the overlying deep water.Here 4.3 x 10(6) m3 s-1 is estimated for the westward-and ultimately northward-transport of AABW.Although this value exceeds previous estimates of net northward transport in the Brazil and Guiana basins made from International Geophysical Year data of the late 1950s, it fits well into an overall scenario constructed from transport estimates made from section data collected during the 1980s.This scenario includes a flow of approximately 7 x 10(6) m3 s-1 of AABW into the Brazil Basin from the south.The magnitude of the northward flow diminishes as it moves toward the equator indicated by estimates of 6.7 x 10(6) m3 s-1 at 23-degrees-S and 5.5 x 10(6) m3 s-1 at 11-degrees-S.At the equator, 4.3 x 10(6) m3 s-1 exits the Brazil Basin to continue northward across the Guiana Basin, and an unquantified amount flows through the Romanche Fracture Zone into the eastern basin.The northward decrease in AABW suggests an upwelling across isotherms.The difference in transports between 11-degrees-S and the equator, 1.2 x 10(6) m3 s-1, is an estimate of the combined amounts of AABW being upwelled and exiting the basin through the Romanche Fracture Zone.In the Guiana Basin at 4-degrees-N, AABW transport is estimated at 4.0 x 10(6) m3 s-1.This flow subsequently splits into two approximately equal flows: continued northward flow through the Guiana Basin, and eastward flow

scaled by the expected geometrical factor of -1/2 relative to the lamellar state.However, we found the occurrence of a further reduction in the H-2 NMR quadrupolar splittings, DELTAnu(Q), of the H-2-Labeled palmitoyl acyl chain segments.These observations point toward the role of interfacial curvature with regard to properties of reverse hexagonal phase lipids, and indicate that the pivotal position or neutral surface of approximately constant area may lie near the glycerol or polar head group region.Variations in the acyl chain packing due to curvature of the aqueous interface yield significant differences in the segmental order profiles as determined by H-2 NMR spectroscopy.The latter reflect the local orientational order of the acyl chains and can be used together with simple statistical theories to extract positional or structural information.Average projected acyl chain lengths and mean interfacial or cross-sectional areas for PLPE-d31 in the different phases have been

lamellar and hexagonal phase order profiles.Here the radius of curvature, R(c), is defined as the distance from the center of the water core to the lipid/water interface, near the carbonyl segments of the acyl chains, giving R(c) = 25.4-28.1 angstrom for PLPE-d31 in the H(II), phase at 60-degrees-C.This value is in good agreement with previous X-ray diffraction studies of

also lead to higher quadrupolar echo relaxation rates (R2e) for the lipid acyl segments closest to the aqueous interface in the H(II) versus the L(alpha) phase.We propose that this enhancement is due to an additional relaxation mechanism found in the hexagonal phases, namely, translational diffusion of lipids about the cylinder axes.For comparison, the normal hexagonal (H(I)) and lamellar

electron-proton hyperfine interaction and by multiple contributions of the electron spin 5/2 manifold.A spin 5/2 Mn2+ ion having magnetic quantum numbers M(s) = +/- 1/2, +/- 3/2, +/- 5/2 and small zero-field splittings has overlapping electron spin EPR transitions.Proton hyperfine couplings to each of these electron spin states have yielded overlapping ENDOR patterns whose interpretation is nontrivial, even in so-simple a system as Mn2+ ion having hexaaquo coordination.We have experimentally obtained and theoretically explained these proton ENDOR patterns and in so doing have laid the foundation for interpreting and sorting out frozen solution ENDOR patterns in more complex (enzyme) environments.Pulsed and cw ENDOR experiments showed features of metal-coordinated water protons occurring not only within a few MHz of the free proton frequency (as will happen for an electron spin 1/2 system) but extending over a range of up to 35 MHz.The EPR line of the Mn2+ S = 512 manifold was broadened by zero-field splitting for hundreds of Gauss away from g=2.00, and the relative intensity of different ENDOR features reflected couplings to differing M(s), spin states at varying fields across this EPR line.An expression was derived to show the dependence of proton ENDOR frequencies on the electron spin quantum number, M(s), upon the principal values of the intrinsic proton hyperfine tensor, upon the direction of the magnetic field, and upon the free proton frequency.This expression provided the starting point for powder simulations of the overall ENDOR pattern.These
