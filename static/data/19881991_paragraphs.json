of surface corrosion and-depending on emersion potential-changes in the oxidation state of copper.On the basis of electrochemical and spectroscopic results, the current wave is attributed to activation of a catalytic mechanism of H2O2 reduction involving copper species.Current oscillations are observed when the polarization conditions are properly set.An 'electrical'' analysis of the oscillatory phenomena is proposed, focused on the conditions of polarization control and resulting circuit (in)stability.At CuInSe2, illumination may be used as a key parameter to switch the

irradiation.The reduction of cell viability is proportional to the increase in anodic photocurrent, suggesting that the photogenerated holes are involved in the cell killing.In order to apply this effect to cancer therapy, TiO2 particles were used instead of TiO2 electrode, which function as a microphotocell.A distinct cell killing effect was also observed by treatment with TiO2 particles and uv light irradiation.In experiments comparing the killing effects using TiO2 particles alone and TiO2 particles with uv irradiation, the photoexcited TiO2 particles significantly suppressed the growth of HeLa cells that were implanted in nude mice.On the basis of these experimental observations, it can be concluded that the cell killing effect of TiO2 under uv light irradiation could be adopted as one of anti-cancer modality."}, {"x": 7, "text": "Fossil fuels present the difficult-to-reconcile dilemma that the energy systems of today's society dictate that we use great quantities of fossil

nanocrystals are surrounded by a matrix, the films are comprised of aggregated nanocrystals.Crystal size (typically from <4 nm to >6 nm), and therefore absorption spectra, can be controlled by deposition temperature, illumination during deposition (for chemically deposited films), solution composition, and post annealing.The crystal size dependence of chemically-deposited films on

approaches suggest that force-dependent receptors are required, ih addition to the well-known systems involved in sway stabilization, for equilibrium control.One approach concerns bilateral leg muscle activation during stance.Unilateral or bilateral leg displacements were induced while subjects stood on a treadmill with split belts.A unilateral displacement induced a bilateral EMG response.During bilateral displacements the EMG activity was linearly summed or subtracted, depending on whether the legs were displaced in the same or opposite directions.Both legs acted in a cooperative manner: each limb affected the strength of muscle activation and the time-space behaviour of the other.This interlimb coordination is suggested to be mediated by spinal interneuronal circuits, which are themselves under supraspinal (e.g., cerebellar) control.The other approach concerns the modulation of postural reflexes under simulated ''microgravity'' in water immersion.An approximately linear relationship was found between contact forces and impulse-directed EMG response amplitudes in the leg muscles.Out of water loading of the subjects resulted in no further increase of the response amplitude.It was concluded that the function of proprioceptive reflexes involved in the stabilization of posture depends on the presence of contact forces opposing gravity.Extensor load receptors are thought to signal changes of the projection of body's centre of mass with respect to the feet.The interaction of the afferent input from these receptors with the other systems involved in postural

involved in the higher oxidation states (Renger, G.(1987) Photosynthetica 21, 203-224).Moreover, the phenomena can be specifically and independently influenced and stimulated e.g.by the addition of various salts which strongly increases the water splitting reaction.In the present discussion on the participation of hydrogen peroxide the reaction sequences described for Oscillatoria in this and in

subsequent effect on the stress state at the crack tip.The lowest Delta K-th, 1.05 MPa m(1/2), was obtained in the AlCl3 solution and this environment caused sufficient splitting at the threshold that plane stress conditions played an important role in events at the crack tip.In all the other test environments, the Delta K-th was similar to 1.7 MPa m(1/2), no splitting was present at the threshold

m(1/2), and causing a sufficient amount of splitting that the crack tip was placed under plane stress conditions throughout Stage 2.Consistent with this, Stage 2 cyclic crack rates, da/dN, were very similar in all the aqueous environments, where they obeyed a power law relationship, da/dN proportional to(Delta K)(4).In contrast, splitting effects were insignificant in desiccated air and the crack tip remained under plane strain conditions throughout the test, leading to out of plane cracking and ridge formation in the mid-thickness of the specimen, and resulting in severe crack growth

75 cm(-1) for dangling-D).These results are in accord with published results for the dimer complexes H2O-ethylene and H2O-benzene that show that benzene and ethylene bond to the water as proton donors.On the other hand, the vibrational spectra show that the acetylene ''bonds'' well, to the ice surface, both as a proton donor and as a proton acceptor.The evidence of this behavior includes the site splitting of the acetylene bands, nu(3) in the infrared and nu(2) in the Raman spectra, of the sample amorphous ice-acetylene.The nu(3) mode of the acetylene is observed as a doublet at 3200 and

for the pair water-acetylene, which show two structural minima with different nu(2) and nu(3) acetylene frequencies, as observed experimentally.On the basis of the downshift of the dangling-H(D) band of the amorphous ice we estimate the bond energy for the acetylene, ethylene, and benzene acting as proton accepters on the amorphous ice as 3.7, 3.8, and 4.3 kcal/mol, respectively.These values are

high-spin hexaaqua complexes in the T-h symmetry of the di- and trivalent 3d metal ions, follow closely the trends found in crystal structure determinations of the isomorphous series of the 3d hexaaqua metal ions in Tutton and alum salts.The variation of the binding energies in a hexaaqua complex shows the double-humped features expected for a splitting of the d orbitals in an octahedral ligand field with the largest stabilization at formal d(3) and d(8) electron configurations of the metal ions.In cases with degenerate d-orbitals, an additional splitting of the energy levels by a lowering of the symmetry of the hexahydrated ion will in some cases significantly increase the binding energy.For the largest d(1) and d(6) metal ions an ''all-vertical'', and for some large d(2) ions an ''air-horizontal'', conformation of the hydrogen atoms of the planarly coordinated water ligands around the trifold axis in the D-3d symmetry is favored.For the hexahydrated d(9) ion Ag2+, the first-order Jahn-Teller effect leading to a tetragonal elongation of the octahedral coordination has been studied.The possibility that the nondistorted d(4) <Cr(H2O)(6)>(2+) complex is forced into a

resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to monitor deuterated water and ethanol and the headgroups and acyl chains of neutral phospholipids.Ethanol was found to interact strongly with both phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bilayers, giving H-2 NMR quadrupolar splittings for CH3CD2OH between 6.3 and 9.4 kHz.The quadrupolar splittings for ethanol in gel-phase lipids remained well resolved and were not significantly larger than those in the L(alpha) phase, suggesting that little or no ethanol was bound in the hydrocarbon interior of the bilayer.Ethanol binding significantly altered the orientation of the lipid headgroups, as shown with headgroup-deuterated PC bilayers.The entire lengths of the acyl chains were significantly disordered by the ethanol interaction, evidenced by significant reductions in the H-2 NMR order parameters of the chains.The disordering corresponds to an increase in the area per lipid by an estimated 6% with one ethanol molecule per lipid, and a total of 18% with a second ethanol per lipid.This pronounced area increase is presumably caused by the disruption of lipid packing in the rigid region of the glycerol backbone rather than in the acyl chains, since the order of hydrocarbon chains is not affected to a significant degree by incorporation of alkanes and long-chain alcohols into the hydrocarbon interior.From these data it was concluded that ethanol interacts with phospholipid bilayers at the lipid-water interface (consisting of the headgroup, glycerol backbone, and uppermost chain methylene

sites indicated that water extraction between 30 and 90 cm was higher for pea and canola in the ZT compared with CT treatment, while soil water extraction by wheat was reduced under ZT.At a second

stripping (oxidation) with low currents at more negative potentials which could be prevented by codeposition of copper and indium.Further, deposition of copper, or copper and indium on CIDS was observed to improve the charge transfer at the CIDS/electrolyte interface.These results were applied for the fabrication of CIDS based photoelectrochemical solar cells employing polysulphide redox electrolyte.It was found that codeposition of copper and indium on CIDS electrode led to significant enhancement in the cell efficiency (rises to 11.5% from 3.4%) and slowed down the short-circuit current decay.A part (70-80%) of the decayed short-circuit current could be regained by renewing the CIDS electrode with codeposition treatment for the second time (redeposition).The possibility of applying deposition-redeposition treatment to regulate the output current was suggested.Previously unexplained cooperative effects of Cu+ and In3+  in polysulphide electrolyte on the cell efficiency

significant external factors that are greatly influencing the market's (utility's) future implementation of new alternative energy-generating technologies.The factor that has possibly the greatest

and the hazards of electromagnetic fields (EMF) from power lines, have all led to more stringent regulations and environmental mandates.The utility business environment itself is rapidly changing.Higher public expectations from energy providers and increasing competition are leading to major changes in the American utility sector.Competitive requirements to reduce the cost of utility service is leading to business decisions that provide both opportunities and problems for increased use of alternative energy-generating technologies, like fuel cells, and/or renewables, such as wind and solar photovoltaics.Bringing new energy technologies to market is very expensive and this financial burden cannot be shouldered by the market, manufacturers or federal government alone.Further, for the market to assume a key position in early commercialization, the technology must offer a strategic and competitive advantage to early buyers.In order to break this problematic cycle of investments depending on market assurance and of market reluctance until cost goals are met, fresh approaches must be sought to address the unique challenges of each commercialization effort.Market-driven collaborations in which potential buyers, such as electric utilities, work together to define and implement a commercialization program that meets the market's requirements, with one or more suppliers, and with the federal government as a catalyst, provide perhaps the best opportunity for further commercialization of renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies.The key is that the market - not government agencies - determines the objectives and manages the resulting program.Two examples of such collaborations, the Fuel Cell Commercialization Group (FCCG) and the

of which the most important will be energy costs at the end-user and the systems' impacts on humans, biosphere, and natural environment.Two global energy scenarios (Dynamic-as-Usual and Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Conservation, with several options for each of the scenarios) until the middle of the next century are discussed in the paper.According to energy projections, energy demand in developed countries is likely to stay at the current level over the whole time period or may even slightly decline (it is quite possible that in some countries with very high per capita energy demand, the reduction of primary energy consumption will start even in the near future).The major part of the energy demand growth worldwide will be justified by the needs of developing countries to improve their economic and social position.It is expected that primary energy demand in developing countries will increase by a factor of 3-5 compared to today's level.The world primary energy mix will very much depend on development strategies applied over the next 50-60 years.If a strategy for massive prevention of global warming is to be required, the share of fossil fuels in primary energy consumption must be remarkably reduced (even down to 25% in case of a 60% CO2 emission reduction until the middle of the next century as stated by IPCC).Electricity keeps its position as a most universal energy carrier in all sectors of end-use, including transportation.Environmental protection goals can be achieved with the most effective and less expensive ways through applying electric technologies.Therefore, a strong growth rate for electricity generation is projected in both regions -

radiation in the presence of a magnetic field is described in which circular polarization is created.The resulting antisymmetric spectral line profile for   this circular polarization resembles that

for the molecular quantum states from a direction that is parallel to the magnetic field to a direction that is parallel to the direction of propagation.When the maser is radiatively saturated, and the  rate for stimulated emission is within an order of magnitude of the Zeeman splitting in frequency units, this ''intensity-dependent circular polarization'' is greater than that due to the ordinary Zeeman effect by factors as large as 1000.The circular polarization that is observed in the spectra of circumstellar SiO (J = 1-0) masers associated with late-type giants and supergiants may then be caused by magnetic fields as weak as about 10 mG.With the standard Zeeman interpretation of the observations, magnetic fields of 10-100 G are indicated.The lower fields are similar to the

the contribution of emissivity is evaluated from coefficients that depend on the spectral emissivities in both thermal channels.Using a wide range of simulations from an atmospheric radiative transfer

by partial soil drying suggested that leaf growth reductions were non-hydraulically induced.Stomatal conductance of plants given low phosphorus was less influenced by nonhydraulic signalling of soil drying than plants given higher phosphorus.Soil drying was not affected by mycorrhizal colonization, and reductions in leaf growth were not related to soil drying rate (characterized by time required for soil matric potential to drop below control levels and by time roots were exposed to soil matric potential below typical leaf water potential).We conclude that mycorrhizal symbiosis acted

{"x": 481, "text": "The performance of indirect passive solar dryers tends to be rather poor because of the low air flow rates which occur through such dryers.These low air flow rates can cause the efficiency of the solar collector to be low and also limit the rate of drying that can be achieved with such systems.Two ways of trying to improve the performance of such dryers are; to use waste fuel to increase the buoyancy forces by heating the air in a chimney attached to the dryer, and to reduce the air gap between the upper transparent cover and the absorber plate in the collector in order to increase heat transfer to the air.This paper, therefore, presents the results of an experimental study in which the effects of heating the air in a chimney fitted to the dryer and the effects of varying the collector gap on the dryer performance have been measured.The tests were done under outdoor conditions in Senegal on two dryers, using four chimney configuration heated with waste sawdust, and using two collectors with air gap heights of 4 and 5 cm.Results indicate that the performance of the dryer can be improved if temperatures in the chimneys are maintained over 50-degrees-C above the ambient for more than 4 hrs and if the chimney is at least 2 metres high.Mean drying rates in the dryer can also be improved by reducing the collector air gap height which should not be greater

the higher lamp power tend to enhance thermal reaction by heating the surface of the catalyst.In contrast to helium, use of argon carrier gas also enhances thermal reaction.Presumably the catalyst surface temperature is greater in the presence of argon due to the lower gaseous thermal conductivity of argon.UV-visible photocatalytic activity is most obvious when a water filter is used to remove

semiconductors (ca.5 nm crystal size).The photoelectrodes, which can be CdSe or CdS, are prepared as nanocrystalline films by either chemical solution deposition or by electrodeposition.They exhibit strong spectral shifts due to size quantization in the nanocrystals.The behavior of the nanocrystalline photoelectrode can be explained by a model whereby the electrolyte makes contact with individual nanocrystals in the porous film.Charges are photogenerated essentially at the surface of the individual crystallites and separation of the charges occurs due to differing kinetics of electron and hole transfer to the electrolyte.The charge which is less rapidly transferred to the electrolyte (usually electrons) can be removed at the back contact, and recombination, which is normally a severe problem in films of such small crystallites, is minimized since the opposite charge is rapidly removed.The photoelectrodes can exhibit both n-type and p-type photoresponse, as defined by direction of

randomly immobilized via lysine residuals when the bifunctional reagent activated for the reaction with amino groups was applied.An oriented immobilization of the RCs via the cysteine residual located

between highly oriented multilayers of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) has been studied in two time domains at different hydration levels.Incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and deuterium-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) longitudinal (T-1) relaxation were employed to investigate both the high-frequency motions of water (10(-9)-10(-11) s time scale) and their anisotropy, while 2H-NMR transverse (T-2) relaxation was used for obtaining information on low frequency dynamical processes (microsecond time scale).Our results show that high frequency dynamics (picosecond-time scale) at low hydration (three to four water molecules per lipid) can be understood solely as a uniaxial rotation of the water molecules tightly bound to DPPC head groups with a correlation time tau(rot) approximate to 62 ps at 55 degrees C and a rotational radius of 1 +/- 0.1 Angstrom, but with no detectable translational degrees of freedom.The 2H-NMR T-1 data (nanosecond-time scale) can be explained satisfactorily on the basis of fast rotations with the correlation time above and a slower reorientation of the rotational axis (correlation time tau 1 approximate to 6 ns).Both QENS and 2H-NMR T-1 measurements provide an apparent activation energy of E(a) = 32 +/- 1.0 kJ/mol for this process.Increasing the hydration level of the multilayers leaves the rotational motion essentially unchanged, but enables additional translational motion which can be considered as a jump diffusion process (diffusion coefficient D = 16 +/- 1X10(-10) m(2)/s at 44 degrees C and a mean residence time of tau(o) = 2.0 +/- 0.5 ps) of nonbound water.It is interesting to note that this diffusion is completely isotropic on the characteristic length scale of this QENS experiment (equal to or less than 10 Angstrom).Temperature variation shows that the phase state of the lipids has no significant effect on the high frequency dynamics of the water molecules.Measurements of the 2H-NMR quadrupolar splitting of water (D2O) at temperatures around the phase transition temperature T-m of the oriented DPPC multilayers clearly show a coexistence of the crystalline L(beta') phase and of the fluid L(alpha) phase over a range of up to 4 degrees C at both sides of T-m.The intermediate P-beta' (''ripple'') phase is suppressed as we worked at hydration levels below saturation.In the coexistence range, exchange of water takes place between crystalline and fluid lipid domains due to water diffusion.This exchange causes a pronounced minimum of the 2H-NMR transverse relaxation time T-2 at T-m since this low frequency process satisfies approximately a critical damping condition for a two-site chemical exchange process."}, {"x": 495, "text": "Orientational phase transitions in axially symmetric condensed phases of water-supported amphiphile monolayers are treated in the model within the mean field approximation.Heads of the molecules are

reduced to free rotation of tails around their long axes and to small oscillations near the mean orientation.The free rotation leads to renormalization of the length constant in LJ potential.It is shown that the interaction of tails can be split into two parts: the larger part is referred to as bulk energy and the smaller as interfacial energy.The constant cross-section rule observed experimentally appears to be satisfied if the bulk energy is taken into account only, but this approximation turns out to be insufficient to distinguish phases with tilting direction either to a nearest neighbour (NN) or to a next-nearest neighbour.The addition of interfacial terms allows the transition from NN to vertical state to be found; this transition can be attributed to the L(2)-LS

discretization method is used involving Fourier modes in the streamwise direction and Chebyshev polynomials along the depth.An explicit integration is performed in time using a splitting scheme.The initial state of the flow is assumed to be a known parallel shear flow with a flat free surface.A perturbation having the form of the fastest growing linear instability mode of the shear flow is then introduced, and its subsequent evolution is followed numerically.According to linear theory, a shear flow with a free surface has two linear instability modes, corresponding to different branches of the dispersion relation: Branch I, at low wavenumbers; and Branch II, at high wavenumbers for low Froude numbers, and low wavenumbers for high Froude numbers.Our simulations show that the two branches

water and/or other surface components.A comparison of the longitudinal relaxation times obtained at theta = 0 degrees and 90 degrees (where theta is the angle between the normal to the glass plates and the magnetic field) revealed a significant T,, anisotropy for all positions.In contrast to the behavior observed with the SPM system, lipid mixtures containing CER exhibited a complex polymorphism.Between 20 and 50 degrees C, a significant portion of the entire membrane (as monitored by both PA-d,, and CHOL-d,) was found to exist as a solid phase, with the remainder either a gel or

as spin adducts of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, and identified on the basis of hyperfine splitting constants of the EPR spectra.We found the following.(i) Singlet oxygen, a non-radical form of active oxygen, was detectable only in samples undergoing acceptor-side-induced photodamage.(ii) The acceptor-side-induced process was accompanied by the oxygen dependent production of carbon centred (alkyl or hydroxyalkyl) radicals, probably from the reaction of singlet oxygen with histidine residues.(iii) Donor-side-induced photoinhibition was dominated by hydroxyl radicals, which were produced in anaerobic samples, too.The production rate of these radicals, as well as D1 protein degradation, was dependent on the possibility of electron donation from manganese ions to Photosystem II.The marked distinction between the active oxygen forms produced in acceptor- and donor-side-induced photoinhibition are in agreement with earlier reports on the different mechanism of

pi-conjugated pyridine rings as measured by light-scattering methods.PPy and PBpy have a rigidly linear rodlike structure as revealed by their showing a theoretically limiting rho(Y) (degree of depolarization) value of 0.33, and they exhibit a large refractive index increment (Delta n/Delta c = 0.59 cm(3) g(-1)) and a large refractive index of n(D) = 2.2.Stretching of poly(vinyl alcohol) film containing the PPy or PBpy molecules in its surface region affords a polarizer which shows a dichroic ratio of 45.The PBpy molecules stand upright on a carbon substrate in a PBpy film vacuum deposited on the carbon substrate as revealed by electron diffractometry.On the other hand, PBpy molecules in a film vacuum deposited on a glass substrate are oriented in parallel with the surface of the glass substrate as revealed by analysis of optical second-harmonic generation from the PBpy film, which shows alignment of all the PBpy molecules attached to the glass substrate (1 x 1 cm) in a same direction: coordination of a PBpy molecule to the Si-O-H group is proposed to explain such orientation of the PBpy molecules.PPy exhibits fluorescence with a peak at 440 nm in a dilute solution (2 x 10(-6) M monomer unit), whereas PPy shows an additional excimer-like emission at 550 nm in a saturated solution (0.5 M monomer unit) and PPy and PBpy films emit only the excimer-like emission at 550 nm.Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence also supports the excimer-like fluorescence.PPy, PBpy, and their alkyl derivatives are electrochemically reduced or n-doped more easily than poly(p-phenylene) and poly(thiophene-2,5-diyl), reflecting pi-electron-deficient nature of the pyridine ring, and E(0) values of -2.2 through -2.5 v vs ag/ag(+) are observed for the polymers; the n-doping and its reverse reaction (n-undoping) are accompanied by a color change (e.g., yellow in the n-undoped state and blue in the n-doped state for PPy and PBpy).Chemically n-doped PPy and PBpy with sodium naphthalide have electrical conductivities of 1.1 X 10(-1) and 1.6 X 10(-1) S cm(-1), respectively, as measured with compressed powder.On the contrary, PPy, PBpy, and their alkyl derivatives undergo p-doping neither electrochemically nor chemically (e.g., by treatment with AsF5), reflecting the pi-deficient nature of the pyridine ring.PBpy and P6HexBpy form complexes with Ru(II), Ni(II), Ni(0), and Fe(III) species, and cyclic voltammetry of the PBpy-Ru complex reveals electron exchange between the coordinated Ru species, which is considered to occur through the pi-conjugation system of the conjugated polymer ligand.The complexes are active for photoevolution of H-2 from aqueous media as well as for reduction of CO2.", "rank": 319,

not only of the impedance of the culture medium but also of changes in the ionic layers at the measuring electrodes, which has advantages in case of high salt concentrations.These changes are expressed as percentage decreases of the initial values, M-value and E-value, respectively.Food samples were pre-enriched 14 to 16 h at 37-degrees-C in peptone water by addition of mannitol, which facilitated the detection of salmonellae on selective culture media.Following this, 0.1 ml of the preenrichment culture was transferred to 9.9 ml of Impedance-Splitting Salmonellae (ISS) medium which consisted of magnesium chloride (hydrated), malachite green oxalate, novobiocin, phosphate buffer, mannitol, peptone and yeast extract.Despite the high magnesium chloride concentration in this medium, salmonellae produced changes of the E-value up to 105%, while the changes in M-values were limited to a few percent.The impedance changes were automatically recorded during incubation in the measuring system for up to 22 h at 40-degrees-C, and the time required to exceed a threshold value of 15% (E reaction time) was evaluated.Comparative testing of the ISS method with standard cultural analysis of 250 unknown food samples showed high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting salmonellae.From all of the 122 Salmonella-positive samples, the largest number (119) was obtained by the ISS method, as
