used to solve computer vision problems.For example, LDA was used to discover objects from a collection of images <2, 3, 4> and to classify images into different scene categories <5>.<6> employed LDA to classify human actions.In visual surveillance, LDA was used to model atomic activities and interactions in a crowded scene <7>.In these applications, LDA clustered low-level visual words (which were image patches, spatial and temporal interest points or moving pixels) into topics with semantic meanings (which corresponded to objects, parts of objects, human actions or atomic activities) utilizing their co-occurrence information.Even with these promising achievements, however, directly borrowing a language model to solve vision problems has some difficulties.First, LDA assumes that a document is a bag of words, such that spatial and temporal structures among visual words, which are meaningless in a language model but important in many computer vision problems, are ignored.Second, users need to define the meaning of documents in vision problems.The design of documents often implies some assumptions on vision problems.For example, in order to cluster image patches, which are treated as words, into classes of objects, researchers treated images as documents <2>.This assumes that if two types of patches are from the same object class, they often appear in the same images.This assumption is reasonable, but not strong enough.As an example shown in Figure 1, even though sky is far from vehicles, if they often exist in the same images in some data set, they would be clustered into the same topic by LDA.Furthermore, since in this image most of the patches are sky and building, a patch on a vehicle is likely to be labeled as building or sky as well.These problems could be solved if the document of a patch, such as the yellow patch in Figure 1, only includes other patches falling within its neighborhood, marked by the red dashed window in Figure 1, instead of the whole image.So a better assumption is that if two types of image patches are from the same object class, they are not only often in the same images but also close in space.We expect to utilize spatial information in a flexible way when designing documents for solving vision problems.In this paper, we propose a Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA) model which encodes the spatial structure among visual words.It clusters visual words (e.g.an eye patch and a nose patch), which often occur in the same images and are close in space, into one topic (e.g.face).This is a more proper assumption for solving many vision problems when images often contain several objects.It is also easy for SLDA to model activities and human actions by encoding temporal information.However the spatial or temporal information is not encoded in the values of visual words, but in the design of documents.LDA and its extensions, such as the author-topic model <8>, the dynamic topic model <9>, and the correlated topic model <10>, all assume that the partition of words into documents is known a priori.A key difference of SLDA is that the word-document assignment becomes a hidden random variable.There is a generative procedure to assign words to documents.When visual words are close in space or time, they have a high probability to be grouped into the same document.Some approaches such as <11, 3, 12, 4> could also capture some spatial structures among visual words.<11> assumed that the spatial distribution of an object class could be modeled as Gaussian and the number of objects in the image was known.Both <3> and <4> first roughly segmented images using graph cuts and added spatial constraint using these segments.<12> modeled the spatial dependency among image patches as Markov random fields."}, {"x": 4, "text": "As an example application, we use the SLDA model to discover objects from a collection of images.As shown in Figure 2, there are different classes of objects, such as cows, cars, faces, grasses, sky, bicycles, etc., in the image set.And an image usually contains several objects of different classes.The goal is to segment objects from images, and at the same time, to label these segments as different object classes in an unsupervised way.It integrates object segmentation and recognition.In our approach images are divided into local patches.A local descriptor is computed for each image patch and quantized into a visual word.Using topic models, the visual words are clustered into topics which correspond to object classes.Thus an image patch can be labeled as one of the object classes.Our work is related to <2> which used LDA to cluster image patches.As shown in Figure 2, SLDA achieves much better performance than LDA.We will compare more results of LDA and SLDA in the experimental section."}, {"x": 6, "text": "To obtain the local descriptors, images are convolved with the filter bank proposed in <13>, which is a combination of 3 Gaussians, 4 Laplacian of Gaussians, and 4 first order derivatives of Gaussians, and was shown to have good performance for object categorization.Instead of only computing visual words at interest points as in <2>, we divide an image into local patches on a grid and densely sample a local descriptor for each patch.A codebook of size W is created by clustering all the local descriptors in the image set using K-means.Each local patch is quantized into a visual word according to the codebook.In the next step, these visual words (image patches) will be further clustered into classes of objects.We will compare two clustering methods, LDA and SLDA."}, {"x": 8, "text": "When LDA is used to solve our problem, we treat local patches of images as words and the whole image as a

j.

Eq 1 is the product of two ratios: the probability of word wji under topic k and the probability of topic k in document j. So LDA clusters the visual words often co-occurring in the same images into one object class."}, {"x": 14, "text": "As shown by some examples in Figure 2 (see more results in the experimental section), there are two problems in using LDA for object segmentation and recognition.The segmentation result is noisy since spatial information is not considered.Although LDA assumes that one image contains multiple topics, from experimental results we observe that the patches in the same image are likely to have the same labels.Since the whole image is treated as one document, if one object class, e.g.car in Figure 2, is dominant in the image, the second ratio in Eq 1 will lead to a large bias towards the car class, and thus the patches of street are also likely to be labeled as car.This problem could be solved if a local patch only considers its neighboring patches as being in the same document."}, {"x": 16, "text": "We assume that if visual words are from the same class of objects, they not only often co-occur in the same images but also are close in space.So we try to group image patches which are close in space into the same documents.One straightforward way is to divide the image into regions as shown in Figure 4 (a).Each region is treated as a document instead of the whole image.However, since these regions are not overlapped, some patches, such as A (red patch) and B (cyan patch) in Figure 4 (a), even though very close in space, are assigned to different documents.In Figure 4 (a), patch A on the cow is likely to be labeled as grass, since most other patches in its document are grass.To solve this problem, we may put many overlapped regions, each of which is a document, on the images as shown in Figure 4 (b).If a patch is inside a region, it could belong to that document.Any two patches whose distance is smaller than the region size could belong to the same document if the regions are placed densely enough.We use the word could because each local patch is covered by several regions, so we have to decide to which document it belongs.Different from the LDA model, in which the word-document relationship is known a priori, we need a generative procedure assigning words to documents.If two patches are closer in space, they have a higher probability to be assigned to the same document since there are more regions covering both of them.Actually we can go even further.As shown in Figure 4 (c), each document can be represented by a point (marked by magenta circle) in the image, assuming its region covers the whole image.If an image patch is close to a document, it has a high probability to be assigned to that document."}, {"x": 17, "text": "The graphical model is shown in Figure 3 (b).In SLDA, there areM documents and N words in the corpus.A

been widely used to solve computer vision problems.For example, LDA was used to discover objects from a collection of images <2, 3, 4> and to classify images into different scene categories <5>.<6> employed LDA to classify human actions.In visual surveillance, LDA was used to model atomic activities and interactions in a crowded scene <7>.In these applications, LDA clustered low-level visual words (which were image patches, spatial and temporal interest points or moving pixels) into topics with semantic meanings (which corresponded to objects, parts of objects, human actions or atomic activities) utilizing their co-occurrence information.Even with these promising achievements, however, directly borrowing a language model to solve vision problems has some difficulties.First, LDA assumes that a document is a bag of words, such that spatial and temporal structures among visual words, which are meaningless in a language model but important in many computer vision problems, are ignored.Second, users need to define the meaning of documents in vision problems.The design of documents often implies some assumptions on vision problems.For example, in order to cluster image patches, which are treated as words, into classes of objects, researchers treated images as documents <2>.This assumes that if two types of patches are from the same object class, they often appear in the same images.This assumption is reasonable, but not strong enough.As an example shown in Figure 1, even though sky is far from vehicles, if they often exist in the same images in some data set, they would be clustered into the same topic by LDA.Furthermore, since in this image most of the patches are sky and building, a patch on a vehicle is likely to be labeled as building or sky as well.These problems could be solved if the document of a patch, such as the yellow patch in Figure 1, only includes other patches falling within its neighborhood, marked by the red dashed window in Figure 1, instead of the whole image.So a better assumption is that if two types of image patches are from the same object class, they are not only often in the same images but also close in space.We expect to utilize spatial information in a flexible way when designing documents for solving vision problems.In this paper, we propose a Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SLDA) model which encodes the spatial structure among visual words.It clusters visual words (e.g.an eye patch and a nose patch), which often occur in the same images and are close in space, into one topic (e.g.face).This is a more proper assumption for solving many vision problems when images often contain several objects.It is also easy for SLDA to model activities and human actions by encoding temporal information.However the spatial or temporal information is not encoded in the values of visual words, but in the design of documents.LDA and its extensions, such as the author-topic model <8>, the dynamic topic model <9>, and the correlated topic model <10>, all assume that the partition of words into documents is known a priori.A key difference of SLDA is that the word-document assignment becomes a hidden random variable.There is a generative procedure to assign words to documents.When visual words are close in space or time, they have a high probability to be grouped into the same document.Some approaches such as <11, 3, 12, 4> could also capture some spatial structures among visual words.<11> assumed that the spatial distribution of an object class could be modeled as Gaussian and the number of objects in the image was known.Both <3> and <4> first roughly segmented images using graph cuts and added spatial constraint using these segments.<12> modeled the spatial dependency
