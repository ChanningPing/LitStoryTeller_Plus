interactions, weights of previously emphasized keywords will begin to decay.Therefore, if they are never investigated again, they will eventually return to their lower weight, but if they are revisited again later, they will increase in weight again.At times, this resulted in the weights of those entities going to zero (thus having no impact on the spatial layout).Across all users processes, the average number of entities where this occurred at least once is 245 (out of the 294 unique entities initially extracted by ForceSPIRE).While these entities did not have an impact on the spatial layout when their weight was set to 0, subsequent semantic interactions continued to use these entities to measure similarity.As a result, entities that may not have been relevant during the

investigation until approximately 54 minutes into the study, where the weight increased from zero (as shown in Figure 28).This happened as a result of him dragging one document close to another on the

helpful spatializations.For example, User4s cluster regarding Nassau transformed into a cluster also containing documents that did not include the term directly, but instead contained terms such as Bahamas and Freeport Star Hotel.These were conceptually related events, and thus the user decided to group them.The structural relationship between these documents can be described as a transitive relationship <27> (i.e., there is a connecting document that contains both terms).One challenge in this form of relationship is determining which terms to use for the transitivity.ForceSPIRE incrementally learned these terms, through semantic interactions such as moving a document near a cluster (confirming membership) and moving a document towards a different cluster (disagreeing with transitive relationship)."}, {"x": 538, "text": "The results indicate that the semantic interactions in ForceSPIRE provided the flexibility for users to investigate and explore data spatially.Semantic interaction provided the expressiveness required to update the model to coincide with the users analytic reasoning.The captured soft data during the investigation supports the analytic product of each user, and was also able to adapt to the different points of emphasis and hypotheses during each investigation.Users regarded semantic interactions not as direct model steering, but as interactions for synthesis.Finally, ForceSPIRE updated the spatialization based on the semantic interactions of the user, and the final layouts were representative of each users findings.Thus, the spatialization was

becomes more persistent, and the location of the document is more resistant to change from the layout algorithm."}, {"x": 631, "text": "Another important aspect of this research task will be to explore effective means of providing visual feedback to users.In a spatialization, the challenge is to determine the correct balance between visual and mathematical feedback, as well as correctly determining the appropriate level of feedback.Visual feedback can be presented by updating the locations of information, changing the color of links between information, etc.to signify the systems response to the users domain knowledge.We plan to experiment with different detail levels of the feedback, such as presenting feedback on the weighting of documents, down to the level of showing the weights of entities.It is also important to allow users to react to the feedback in case the system misinterpreted the analytical reasoning of the users.For example, feedback on the entities causing the similarity within a cluster can be represented using a tag cloud, where entities with strong weights are represented larger.Users can correct the similarity in this visual metaphor by changing the size of the entities, or removing them completely.The form of the visual feedback should correspond to the users understanding of the space.For example, document similarities could be expressed through proximity, while entity importance could be expressed through highlighting.One important outcome of this approach is that important information should become more visually salient to the user."}, {"x": 636, "text": "What information regarding the analytic process can be uncovered from analyzing the soft data after an investigation?"}, {"x": 639, "text": "An important and powerful characteristic of semantic interaction is the capture and use of soft data.In the purest sense, soft data is the interpreted result of a user interaction, stored in such a way so that the model can incorporate this information for future computation.Therefore, soft data can immediately benefit a system through allowing the model to compute on not only the raw data (i.e., the hard data), but also include the quantified form of the users domain expertise.However, there are benefits of soft data beyond the immediate benefits to the model.Users can analyze soft data during or after their investigation for provenance and history purposes.The collection of soft data can serve as a recollection aid to users needing to reconstruct their analytic process.Further, resulting soft data from one investigation can be reapplied to another dataset, as well as streaming data.Users can observe how their domain expertise from one dataset can extend to another."}, {"x": 644, "text": "Effects of Semantic Interaction on Analytic Process One approach is to observe users analyzing a textual dataset using a prototype, ForceSPIRE, which utilizes semantic interaction (and thus captures soft data throughout the analysis).To provide a realistic intelligence analysis task with a known ground truth to evaluate the performance of the users against, we plan to use one of the VAST Challenge Datasets <58>.One can collect both qualitative results in terms of the behavior and processes of the users, as well as quantitative results such as how close their findings match the known ground truth, and each of the users soft data.As soft data gives us a quantified form of the users domain knowledge and intuition regarding the dataset, we can analyze that information to establish a level of bias.If the goal of a successful visual analytic system is to balance human intuition with statistical models, the balance between hard data and soft data can provide one such measure.The questions to answer are what is the balance, and how much intuition is needed (and how much is too much, or too little)?The soft data will give an idea of how much the user has guided the model through weighting of entities and documents, and how much the user has constrained the model through pinning documents in specific locations."}, {"x": 645, "text": "Soft Data Analysis Another goal is to perform an in-depth analysis of the soft data captured during a users analysis with the aim of detecting trends and patterns indicative of specific analytic behaviors.As exploratory data analysis consists of the situated generation and testing of a users domain insight on the dataset, gaining insight into the amount of bias being introduced into the system is beneficial.For example, converging trends in the weighting of entities can indicate confirmation bias, where diverging weights can represent an analysis involving multiple hypotheses.In particular, we may be able to quantify specific biases such as confirmation bias <35>, and thus design real-time alerts to users that these specific biases are occurring during their analyses."}, {"x": 646, "text": "Capturing the Users Mental Model Also, it is worth investigating the effectiveness of semantic interaction to combine the intuition of users with the computational findings of algorithms.In essence, does semantic interaction enable users the functionality required to transform the layout into one that more closely matches their mental model?A goal of semantic interaction is to allow the model to better learn and match the mental model of the user.As the domain knowledge is being captured and integrated into the model through soft data, the aim is to have a closer connection between the layout and the mental model the user has of the information.We propose to use subjective measures of closeness to analyze if the incremental change of the layout creates less entropy between the two models (mental model and statistical model).Another way to assess the success of this goal is to ask one user to analyze the final layout and soft data of another user, and ask them to extract the findings and hypotheses.If the layout and model successfully captures the domain knowledge and insights of the user, our hypothesis is that another user could analyze this information and arrive at similar conclusions  as well as gain an understanding of the users process and decisions."}, {"x": 650, "text": "The amount of information is rapidly increasing in quantity and complexity.However, the computational foraging abilities of computers are extraordinary, and continue to advance.Visual analytics has embraced the necessary challenge of merging fields such as visualization, cognition, data mining, and others for the purpose of supporting sensemaking.Semantic interaction can contribute to this challenge by providing one approach for analyzing large datasets.Currently, semantic interaction focuses on the weighting of all characteristics of a dataset.However, the principles can be extended to steer not only the dimensions reduction model, but also a querying system that is tied to a database backend.As such, semantic interaction can control what information (filtered from a much larger, dynamic dataset) is shown to the user base on the inferred analytical reasoning."}], "scenes": [["National_Science_Foundation",
