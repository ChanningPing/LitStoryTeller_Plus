by the CPU Time for FastLDA.For these data sets, we see speedups between 3 and 8, with speedup increasing with higher number of topics.The fraction of topics FastLDA must consider on average per

variety of data sets and topic settings.On the two huge data sets, NYTimes and PubMed, FastLDA shows a consistent 5.7 to 7.5 speedup.This speedup is non-trivial for these larger computations.For

directly affects speedup, as shown in Figure 9.This is because using a larger Dirichlet parameter smooths the distribution of topics within a document, and gives higher probability to topics that may be irrelevant to any particular document."}, {"x": 65, "text": "Topic modeling of text collections is rapidly gaining importance for a wide variety of applications including information retrieval and

documents and the total corpus grows, it becomes increasingly important to be as computationally efficient as possible."}, {"x": 66, "text": "In this paper, we have described a method for increasing the speed of LDA Gibbs sampling while providing exactly equivalent samples, thus retaining all the optimality guarantees associated with the original LDA algorithm.By organizing the computations in a better way, and constructing an adaptive upper bound on the true normalization constant, we can take advantage of the sparse and predictable nature of the topic association probabilities.This ensures both rapid improvement of the adaptive bound and that high-probability topics are visited early, allowing the sampling process to stop as soon as the sample value is located."}, {"x": 67, "text": "We find that this process gives a 38 factor of improvement in speed, with this factor increasing with greater numbers of topics.These speed-ups are in addition to improvements gained through other means (such as the parallelization technique of Newman et al.<14>), and can be used in conjunction to make topic modeling of extremely large corpora practical.The general method we describe, to avoid having to consider all possibilities when sampling from a discrete distribution, should be applicable to other models as well.In particular we expect the method to work well for other varieties of topic model, such as the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process <18> and Pachinko allocation <11>, which have a sampling step similar to LDA.However, how to maintain an efficient upper bound for Z, the accuracy of the bound, and an efficientto maintain ordering in which to consider topics, remain model specific problems."}], "scenes": [["Dirichlet_distribution", "Gibbs_sampling"],
