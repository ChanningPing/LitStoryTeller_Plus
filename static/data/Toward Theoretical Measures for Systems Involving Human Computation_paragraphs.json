spikes occur, they then examine the DPH view of the timesteps immediately preceding the increase in attacks.In this view, they observe a pattern: in the two timesteps immediately preceding the attacks, there is a shift in the DPH level of the Thai Ethnic identity from the Regime level (Fig.3.8(a)) to the System level (Fig.3.8(b)).Additionally, there is also a shift in the Isan group, bringing them from the System level (Fig.3.8(a)) up to the Incumbent level (Fig.3.8(b)).Both of these patterns occur immediately before nearly all of the spikes in Attack.From this, the analysts

intuitive if equal contribution values in the control panel equated to equal contribution of attributes in the distance function.Along with this normaliza- tion, we would like to explore the utility of offering the user several initial predefined options depending on the data being examined in order to minimize the amount of time and effort required to properly tune the distance function."},

identical with the exception of a slight shift in time should be almost nonexistant.However, Euclidean distance has no mechanism to recognize this."}, {"x": 131, "text": "Because of this, we have

require the system to dynamically load data, potentially resulting in di- minished performance.However, the benefits to a combined system that does not require context-switching on the part of the

subroutine, the number of queries to the Human Oracles could be as high as O(n2 m4) in the event that all n labels need to be guessed for each sub image before we arrive at the input label.The machine must then compare the value returned by each query to the collection of previous guesses for that round to determine if there has been a match.Assuming an efficient data structure, each lookup or insertion would incur a cost on the order of log(n).In addition, each of the n possible returned labels must be compared against the input label.This results in a total machine cost of O(n2  m4  log(n) + n).Comparing these two tuples, it is clear that Peekaboom is a more efficient method for bounding an object in an image than the ESP Game approximation in terms of both human and machine computation."}, {"x": 340, "text": "Perhaps more interestingly, the examples given in Chapter 6 demonstrate that an algorithm requiring more information (Peekaboom requires a predefined label) as well as interactivity (Boom must be able to touch the image) can be simulated using a polynomial number of calls to an algorithm with limited interac- tivity and unrestricted search space (ESP).This sheds important light on the value of this additional information and power, and the scale of the cost incurred if we are forced to solve the same problem using an intuitively weaker machine.This notion of stronger and weaker suggests that the way in which human computation is leveraged as part of an algorithmic process may be used to induce complexity classes that partition the space of human computation.In the remainder of this chapter, we will discuss several additional dimensions along which human computation may be classified and compared."}, {"x": 342, "text": "First, we can consider whether or not the sequence of queries to the Human Oracle can be determined in advance.In an algorithm with predetermined query order, we claim that there exists some function: general example of a process that uses predetermined queries is semi-supervised machine learning.In these techniques, the Human Oracle is asked to label a set of training data which is then used to infer a classification function.While the resulting classification function is dependent on how the training data is labeled, the points to be used as training data are determined in advance."}, {"x": 343, "text": "Relaxing this restriction yields algorithms whose future queries may be con- tingent on the Human Oracles answers to previous queries.In an algorithm with adaptive query order, we claim that there exists some function: that takes as input a problem instance I as well as (a1,...,an), the sequence of responses from the Human Oracle so far, and generates the next query (qn+1).An excellent example of processes that utilize adaptive querying is active learning.In active learning algorithms, the Human Oracle is first asked to label some small set of training data.Based on their responses, the algorithm reclusters the data.It then selects a new subset of points about which it is least confident and submits these to the Human Oracle to label.The selection of each subsequent collection of points is directly related of the labels provided in the previous round.This process continues iteratively until some confidence threshold is met."}, {"x": 345, "text": "7.1.2 Oracle Responses"}, {"x": 346, "text": "Next, we can consider whether or not the Human Oracle is able to compute on its previous responses in order to generate a future response.Mirroring the previous dimension, some systems assume that the Human Oracles responses to queries are independent of one another.An example of a real-world system where this is true is reCAPTCHA <vAMM+08>, a human computation system for optical character recognition (OCR).If the same human is asked to pass several reCAPTCHA in- stances, she will not gain any information in the process of solving a single instance that would change her answers to new instances further down the line.Thus, we can presume that each of her responses is independent.When this is the case, there is no discernible difference between asking the same Oracle n questions, or asking n different Oracles one question each.As such, processes leveraging Human Oracles whose responses are independent can be parallelized.Because these Human Oracles have no awareness of their previous responses, we refer to them as forgetful."}, {"x": 347, "text": "As mentioned in Chapter 5, it is sometimes useful to endow the Human Ora- cle with some amount of persistent memory regarding the query sequence.In these systems, the Human Oracle may be able to modify its future behavior based on previous events.In the simplest sense, this could be used to ensure that the Human Oracle does not return the same answer twice as seen in the Image Labeling examples in Chapter 6.In other scenarios, we may wish to enable computation on this sequence in order to model more nuanced adaptations, such as learning or fa- tigue.For example, complex systems such as visual analytics tools require that the Human Oracle be able to learn from a prior sequence of actions and responses and subsequently modify its future behavior.Note that while we continue to develop more robust models of human memory and its limits, we may abstract the specifics of how the Human Oracle remembers and instead include the cost of accessing this memory in the query cost.Because these Human Oracles can remember and com- pute on their previous answers, effectively gaining knowledge from their response history, we refer to them as wise."}, {"x": 348, "text": "As with the previous dimension, any result that can be computed on a ma- chine with a forgetful Human Oracle can also be computed on a machine with a wise Human Oracle; when simulating a forgetful machine, the wise Human Oracles memory remains unused.The inverse is not true, as the responses returned by a wise Human Oracle may not be parallelizable.Thus, the class of problems solvable using a forgetful Human Oracle machine is entirely contained within the class of problems solvable using a wise Human Oracle machine (see Fig.7.2)."}, {"x": 350, "text": "In addition to whether or not the Human Oracle has memory of and can compute on its previous responses, we can also consider whether or not the Human Oracle can inject supplemental information into the computation process on its own.This is tantamount to asking whether or not the Human Oracle is allowed to provide answers to questions that were not directly asked.In many existing human compu- tation algorithms, the human or collection of humans is asked to perform a specific computational process as a subroutine to a larger algorithm, such as labeling a par- ticular image.Under this restriction, the Human Oracle does not have any power to interject new information or redirect the computational process.This is consis- tent with the standard Oracle Turing Machine model; the Oracle is simply a set, and can only answer questions about membership in that set.All of the algorithms under consideration in Chapter 6 and in many other Games with a Purpose-style hu- man computation systems such as Fold.it <CKT+10> for finding lower energy protein foldings fall within this category."}, {"x": 351, "text": "Alternatively, the Human Oracle may be given some autonomy regarding the interjection of supplemental information into the computational process.That is, in addition to responding to queries generated by the computational process, the Human Oracle may spontaneously provide new information that may then impact future computation.This adds an additional level of computational power to the Human Oracle.For example, the Human Oracle may have its own computational agenda such as in the use of Visual Analytics systems, and may therefore inject supplemental information to direct the computation in a specific direction.Indeed, we suggest that this supplemental information may in fact be integral to the suc- cess of many Visual Analytics systems that leverage the domain expertise or lived experience that is yet impossible to simulate within purely mechanical analysis."}, {"x": 353, "text": "7.2 Describing the Space of Human Computation"}, {"x": 354, "text": "In contrast to previous schema for comparing human computation systems which rely on nominal classification dimensions <QB11>, each of the dimensions introduced here has an implicit notion of magnitude that induces an partial ordering on different algorithms and problems.Consider the systems and techniques listed in Table 7.1.Categorizing along these three dimensions, we see that many of our intuitions about the relative strength of these techniques are captured.For example, we see the algorithm underlying reCAPTCHA can be computed with a less powerful Human Oracle than the ESP Game.In reCAPTCHA, the human is simply a visual decoder, and the machine takes care of compiling and aggregating the results.In the ESP Game, more responsibility is placed on each individual human to avoid performing redundant computation in order to generate a selection of unique labels.Similarly, we see that active learning requires a more powerful use of human computation than semi-supervised learning.We presume that by enabling more careful selection of user constraints or labels, the set of datasets that can be classified using active learning is broader than the set of datasets that could be classified using semi-supervised learning, given the same amount of supervision."}, {"x": 355, "text": "Because they define a partial ordering between problems, these dimensions can be used to establish preliminary complexity classes within the space of human computation (see Fig.7.3).We suggest that these classes are complementary to those in traditional computational complexity.Indeed, we may consider these hier- archies to be orthogonal.That is, there could exist human-computer collaborative systems with all combinations of H,M.For example, the ESP Game lives at the intersection of predetermined query order, wise Human Oracle and O(n2)  P, while Fold.it exists where adaptive query order, wise Human Oracle meets NP."}, {"x": 356, "text": "Note that this hierarchy is still a work in progress; several of the relationships between these classes are still awaiting discovery (see Fig.7.4).For example, how does the class of problems solvable by a fixed query order, forgetful Human Oracle machine with supplemental information relate to the class of problems solvable using a machine with adaptive query order, a forgetful Human Oracle and no supplemental information?How does this compare to a machine with fixed query order, a wise Human Oracle and no supplemental information?These questions, along with the discovery of canonical or complete problems in this space, are the subject of our future research in this area."}, {"x": 359, "text": "The affordance-based framework presented in this dissertation sheds important light on the ways in which the human mind can be harnessed as a computational resource.In addition, the Human Oracle Model provides a critical first step in quantifying the use of these resources, and helps us to better understand the intricate relationships among different problems and problem families when viewed through the lens of human computation.That said, this dissertation only just scratches the surface of this potentially rich area for future research.This model ignores some very real factors present in any system involving the variability of biological computation.In the following sections, we will discuss some of the limitations of this model, as well as motivate our continued research in this area."}, {"x": 360, "text": "8.1 Limitations of the Human Oracle Model 8.1.1 Imperfect Oracles"}, {"x": 361, "text": "Under this model, there is an explicit assumption the Human Oracle will always be able to provide the correct answer at a fixed cost.In reality, humans dont work this way.Intuition and experience indicate that humans eventually get tired or bored, and as a consequence their speed and accuracy suffer.In addition, individual differences in ability and cost are absent.In the real world, not all humans are equal in their capacity to answer the questions we ask.Some are more skilled or have better training, and their expertise comes (we presume) at a higher cost.Similar issues have arisen in the area of active learning, which has historically assumed a single tireless, flawless, benevolent oracle was always available to provide labels for its training data.Proactive learning relaxes these assumptions, adopting a decision-theoretic approach to match one of a collection of (possibly imperfect) oracles to each instance <DC08>.More recent work in the area of multiple expert ac- tive learning (MEAL) improves upon this model by incorporating load balancing to ensure that no worker has to shoulder an inequitable share of the burden <WSBT11>.These methods assume there exists some method to model both how hard any single problem instance is, as well as how costly and effective a given worker is."}, {"x": 362, "text": "8.1.2 Quantifying the Human Brain"}, {"x": 365, "text": "8.2 Why Develop Complexity Measures for Human Com- putation?"}, {"x": 368, "text": "There is an implicit assumption that the use of human processing power in such systems will be judicious.After all, we have observed that there is a point at which human processors will simply refuse to perform any more computation.Much effort has been put into learning how to best incentivize human processors to perform computation through financial <MW10a, SM11> and social <CH11> mecha- nisms.Games with a Purpose try to make participation more entertaining for the human <vA06>, thereby increasing their willingness to contribute.However, to date there has been little progress toward measures for describing how the computational tasks are being allocated, and few mechanisms have been developed for comparing the algorithmic processes underlying human computation systems independent of the details of their implementation."}, {"x": 371, "text": "We argue that developing these analytical tools, establishing bounds on our algorithmic processes and deepening our understanding of the relationships among the problems were trying to solve are of critical importance to the study and design of systems involving human computation.Drawing parallels at the algorithmic level rather than at the implementation level will enable us to compare solutions more effectively than using simple A-B testing.In human computation as with other branches of computational science, identifying areas where existing algorithms are redundant or inefficient will enable us to design more efficient algorithms in the future.In addition, reporting bounds on the complexity of human computation algorithms along with the observed performance of the system would improve study reproducibility, as well as help isolate the effects of interface design and other im- plementation details."}, {"x": 377, "text": "In this dissertation, we have explored the complementary nature of human and ma- chine computation through three interrelated research thrusts.First, we described the development of two successful visual analytics systems for exploring complex behavioral simulations in political science.Through in situ expert analysis, we demonstrated the utility of these human-computer collaborative analytics systems and their superior performance relative to preexisting manual practices.Second, we presented a framework for comparing human-computer collaborative systems according to relative strengths of human and machine collaborators on which they rely.Finally, we introduced the Human Oracle Model as a method for characterizing and quantifying the use of human processing power as part of an algorithmic pro- cess.We demonstrated the utility of this model for comparing and analyzing several well-known human computation systems for image labeling and described how this model can be used to characterize the space of human computation.In closing, we discussed the models limitations and its potential for broader impact.Through this research, we hope to form a more holistic picture of the interrelationship between human and machine computation, and to develop a robust theoretical model for the analysis of systems involving their collaboration."}],
