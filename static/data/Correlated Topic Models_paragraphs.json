from a mixture of topics.The topics are shared by all documents in the collection; the topic proportions are document-specific and randomly drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.LDA allows each document to exhibit multiple topics with different proportions, and it can thus capture the heterogeneity in grouped data that exhibit multiple latent patterns.Recent work has used LDA in more complicated document models <9, 11, 7>, and in a variety of settings such as image processing <12>, collaborative filtering <8>, and the modeling of sequential data and user profiles <6>.Similar models were

fail to directly model correlation between topics.In manyindeed mosttext corpora, it is natural to expect that subsets of the underlying latent topics will be highly correlated.In a corpus of scientific articles, for instance, an article about genetics may be likely to also be about health and disease, but unlikely to also be about x-ray astronomy.For the LDA model, this limitation stems from the independence assumptions implicit in the Dirichlet distribution on the topic proportions.Under a Dirichlet, the components of the proportions vector are nearly independent; this leads to the strong and unrealistic modeling assumption that the presence of one topic is not correlated with the presence of another.In this paper we present the correlated topic model (CTM).The CTM uses an alternative, more flexible distribution for the topic proportions that allows for covariance structure among the components.This gives a more realistic model of latent topic structure where the presence of one latent topic may be correlated with the presence of another.In the following sections we develop the technical aspects of this model, and then demonstrate its potential for the applications envisioned above.We fit the model to a portion of the JSTOR archive of the journal Science.We demonstrate that the model gives a better fit than LDA, as measured by the accuracy of the

imposed by the Dirichlet in LDA is not realistic when analyzing document collections, where one may find strong correlations between topics.The covariance matrix of the logistic normal in the CTM is introduced to model such correlations.In Section 3, we illustrate how the higher order structure given by the covariance can be used as an exploratory tool for better understanding and navigating a large corpus of documents.Moreover, modeling correlation can lead to better predictive distributions.In some settings, such as collaborative filtering,the goal is to predict unseen items conditional on a set of observations.An LDA model will predict words based on the latent topics that the observations suggest, but the CTM has the ability to predict items associated with additional topics that
