the correct operations, we discovered evidence pointing to potential difficulties at all five leverage points discussed above.We organize these pieces of evidence and identify two major gaps that prevented successful visualization creation: visualization gap and construction gap."}, {"x": 383, "text": "One participant was so interested in Ploceus that he asked for some extra time after the given tasks to perform some open-ended exploration.One of the questions he wanted to know was who got the most money from NSF.He tried to create a net- work connecting researchers with amounts, and then tried to order the amount nodes by value in the list view.While this is certainly one way to answer the question, a bar chart might be a more effective visual representation than a network visualiza- tion.In this regard, the user should have picked a system like Tableau <6> instead of Ploceus.This observation is consistent with what Kobsa <59> has noted in his evalu- ation study of early InfoVis systems: users tend to use the default system or setting given to them, and it is difficult for them to initialize a change in the mindset to explore alternative representations or system settings.One potential solution to this problem is to incorporate good visualization practice and design principles into the system intelligently.We discuss an inspired idea for future work on natural language interfaces in Section 6.2.5."}, {"x": 393, "text": "As we have seen in Section 4.2.2, the relational join is a crucial concept in constructing graphs from multiple data tables.While

modeling, there might be multiple reasonable equi-join conditions."}, {"x": 394, "text": "Consider an IMDB (Internet Movie Database) dataset containing information about movies, persons working on the

and avoiding anomalies in data modification <34>.These goals are not emphasized in NoSQL databases.It would be interesting to explore if the problem of mandatory join specification can then be eliminated if we choose NoSQL data model (key-value pairs instead of data tables) as our input data model."}, {"x": 405, "text": "Consider a dataset about researchers and their academic publications.A

between researcher nodes indicate the relationship of citation.Currently in our framework, no operation can transform the network in Figure 65 to that in Figure 66.Projection is the closest candidate,

design.Through our informal evaluation, we have gained insights on the implications of our design choices.The examples and analysis scenar- ios also demonstrated the potential utility of our framework and the Ploceus system.These findings will need to be strengthened and vindicated through real-world use case scenarios.We would like to know if the utility of the system varies according to the semantics of the data set and problem domain, and if integrating network modeling with exploratory analysis provides enhanced analytic power, thus leading to more insights about the data.Performing Multi-dimensional In-depth Long-term Case Studies <78> is an appropriate evaluation strategy we can pursue.Case studies provide ecologically valid evidence that can demonstrate the potential benefits and shortcomings of the system.The longitudinal nature also makes possible detailed understanding of how analysts strategies evolve over time."}, {"x": 414, "text": "A comparative study can provide insights about the design of interface in Ploceus as compared with alternative systems with similar design goals.The Orion system <49> is a potential candidate where it is designed for the similar purpose of supporting network modeling.Their approach, however, is different from ours in that they expose more technical details to the users and put a stronger focus on automated graph edge construction using path finding algorithms.Our approach is more human-centered.For example, to create nodes from a table, users will promote a raw table column to become a full table in their system Orion.In Ploceus, this operation is achieved when users drag and drop table columns, and users do not have to be concerned about how the newly created nodes are represented at the data structure level.To create a one-mode network, the Orion system will find all possible linking paths between raw data tables as well as promoted data tables and list them for users to choose (Figure 67).In Ploceus, analysts will likely perform such construction via multiple steps using node creation, edge creation and projection operations.In doing so, we are assuming that analysts know what network they want to construct, and they retain full control of the construction process."}, {"x": 415, "text": "The differences in these design choices represent trade-offs that have implications on system usability.We can ask participants to perform the same network modeling tasks using Ploceus and Orion respectively and compare their performance.Since Orion is essentially a stand-alone modeling interface that is decoupled from network exploratory analysis, such a comparative study will also shed light on the utility, if any, of providing immediate visual feedback in the process of model-based visual analysis."}, {"x": 416, "text": "Figure 67: The Orion User Interface, consisting of (a) a schema viewer for manipulating data tables and (b) a linker interface for creating network models.Analysts drag-and-drop desired node types to the linker and Orion responds with (c) a table of possible linking paths.The (d) preview display shows the resulting network data."}, {"x": 418, "text": "Scalability is an important issue in Information Visualization and Visual Analytics research.An implication of the network modeling power provided by Ploceus is that analysts can easily create both big graphs with thousands or even millions of nodes and dense graphs where the number of edges is close to the maximum possible number of edges.Visualizing and analyzing these graphs remain great research challenges.Due to the limited number of pixels available on computer screens, it is impossible to display all the nodes without resulting in cluttering or overlapping.Dense edges also cause severe performance issues in computing graph layout.In Ploceus, the problem of scale is handled using subnetwork sampling.The interface displays bold messages to remind analysts that only a subnetwork is shown.Analysts can interactively add or remove subnetworks through search queries."}, {"x": 422, "text": "One idea we wish to pursue further is the adoption of natural language inter- faces.Language is a natural and often effective way for users to articulate what they would like to see and do.For example, instead of having to mentally visualize appropriate visualizations and to construct the visualizations diligently in multiple steps, users could just articulate their intents through words such as Show me the relationship between researchers and program managers, or How is Georgia Tech doing in terms of getting grants?.Ideally the system will be able to parse these natural language queries, either spoken or typed by the users, and then to identify the plausible construction steps using the operations provided in the framework, and to choose appropriate visual encodings to present the final visualizations to the users."}, {"x": 423, "text": "The idea proposed here sounds like a very difficult artificial intelligence (AI) prob- lem.We believe, however, that the problem is actually much more tractable than hard AI problems such as natural language understanding.A major difficulty in this idea is to parse the natural language queries, and this parsing problem is constrained in two ways.First, the vocabulary used often comes from the underlying data space.For example, in How is Georgia Tech doing in terms of getting grants?, we can identify the nouns without too much difficulty and these nouns presumably are usually data table names, data columns names or specific data cell values.Secondly, the structure of such natural language queries may be mapped to structures in visualizations.For example, in Show me the relationship between researchers and program managers, the structure in the form of relationship between X and Y can be mapped to a restricted set of visualization types by analyzing the data types of X and Y."}],

imported and the columns within each table.The network schema view is a sandbox-like environment where users can construct and manipulate networks at a conceptual level, and shows a schema representation of the network users are currently modeling and analyzing.The network visualization view is where visual exploration and analysis take place, and shows immediate visual feedback on the network being created and updates whenever the network schema is modified.Users can create as many networks as they wish, and each network is shown in a tab.When users switch between the tabs, the network schema view will update accordingly to reflect the schema of the network they are currently examining.The filter panel provides a set of range sliders to filter nodes and edges shown in the
