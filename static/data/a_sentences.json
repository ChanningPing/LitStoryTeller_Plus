already inhibited by Ca2+-depletion.(ii) The carboxylic acids act in the S3-state, are much less effective in S2 and have no effect in the S1-state.(iii) The extrinsic polypeptides (17- and 23-kDa)

values of this ratio a decay is observed.In addition, the highest oxygen-evolving activity in PSII-PG vesicles is attained immediately after reconstitution, then the activity declines with time.Moreover, the largest oxygen-evolving activity values in the PSII-PG vesicles are observed at MgCl2 concentrations in the incubation medium which are above the aggregation threshold of the

about minimization of electrostatic interactions in the PSII-PG vesicle complex.Thus, diffusion of PSII units in the PG vesicle matrix is not restricted by the negative charge in the PO- group of PG.It comes out then that a reasonable mechanism underlying the MgCl2-mediated effects is cooperation between PSII units with concomitant enhancement of oxygen evolution owing to increased probability of collision between PSII units leading to transient, or more or less permanent contacts.This hypothesis provides a novel basis to account for the function of the water-splitting complex in the narrow

that in dark-adapted leaves of spinach and pea, over 30% of the Photosystem II reaction centers are unable to reduce plastoquinone to plastoquinol at physiologically meaningful rates.Several lines of evidence show that the impaired reaction centers are effectively inactive, because the rate of oxidation of the primary quinone acceptor, Q(A), is 1000 times slower than in normally active reaction centers.However, there are conflicting opinions and data over whether inactive Photosystem II complexes are capable of oxidizing water in the presence of certain artificial electron acceptors.In the

from the normally inactive Photosystem II reaction centers that have been activated in the presence of DCBQ, demonstrating their capacity to oxidize water in repetitive flashes, as concluded by Graan

suggested that the first formed radical anions are rapidly protonated either on the ring nitrogen <N(3)> or on the amino nitrogen.In the former, there is no extra splitting from the added proton and a major doublet is observed because of hyperfine coupling to the C(6) proton <C(6)-H>.In the latter case, the proton is thought to add along a path normal to the plane of the ring so that overlap with the SOMO is maximised, and there is a large hyperfine coupling.Coupling to the other two amino protons is too small to resolve under these conditions.The fact that the -N(CH3)2 derivative gives a

PI-jk(A) of the laser, B(i)(0), the magnetic flux density of the permanent magnet, and the imaginary part of a rank three mediating molecular property tensor, (m-beta\"-ijk(ee))mn, a transition magnetic/electric/electric hyperpolarisability called the \"beta tensor\".The beta tensor exists both in diamagnetics and paramagnetics, both chiral and achiral in structure, and is closely related to the mediating tensor of the Faraday effect.The effect of the energy DELTA-H1 is to split a conventional NMR spectrum into a much richer pattern, governed by the beta tensor selection rules DELTA-J = 0, +/- 1, +/- 2, DELTA-M = 0, +/- 1, +/- 2, and by Lande coupling with the conventional (nuclear spin) NMR Hamiltonian.The diagrammatic perturbation calculus and properties of beta close to optical resonance are examined, the point group symmetries and selection rules of beta are tabulated for all molecular point groups, the FMD simulation is initiated in water of the molecular dynamics and transient ensemble responses mediated by beta, and generalised Langevin-Kielich functions are given of the beta mediated orientational response of the molecular ensemble.Suggestions are made for the

relaxation properties and from the spectral characteristics of E11 sperm whale Mb point mutants.Quantitative analysis of the E11 residue dipolar shifts demonstrates that the loss of coordinated H2O leads to a substantial increase in the zero-field splitting constant, D.The change from strongly low-field meso-H shifts in six-coordinate sperm whale metMbH2O to strongly upfield meso-H shifts in five-coordinate Aplysia metMb is accompanied by predicted changes in chemical shifts for heme methyl, F8 His C-beta-H, and E11 Val methyl protons.The most readily recognized change is the 5-ppm low-field bias of the mean methyl shift upon loss of water coordination.The consistency in the changes of all the NMR spectral parameters supports the use of the meso-H chemical shifts as probes for ligation state but suggests that all accompanying changes should be analyzed.Substitution of E11 Val by Ile, Phe, or Ala results in minimal perturbation with full retention of coordinated water.Substitution of E7 His by Val or Phe abolishes H2O coordination, while replacement by Gln or Gly leads to a fractional H2O coordination.The sensitivity of the hyperfine shifts of the heme methyl protons to solvent isotope composition supports the proposed changes in H2O ligation.The application of the heme mean methyl shifts as a probe for H2O coordination in a series of natural genetic variants differing in E7 residue confirms previous conclusions, except for elephant metMb (E7 Gln) which is concluded here to be primarily five-coordinate rather than six-coordinate.The occupation of

NH2NH2 <Renger, G., Messinger, J., & Hanssum, B.(1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., Ed.)Vol.1, pp 845-848, Kluwer, Dordrecht> but also in the presence of NH2OH.(d) Activation energies, E(A), of 50 kJ/mol were determined for the NH2R-induced reduction processes that alter the oxygen oscillation pattern from dark-adapted thylakoids.(e) Although marked differences exist between NH2OH and NH2NH2 in terms of the reduction mechanism and efficiency (which is about 20-fold in favor of NH2OH), both NH2R species exhibit the same order of rate constants as a function of the redox state S(i) in the nonperturbed water oxidase: kNH2R(S0) > kNH2R(S1) << kNH2R(S2) >> kNH2R(S3) The large difference between S2 and S3 in their reactivity toward NH2R is interpreted to indicate that a significant change in the electronic configuration and nuclear geometry occurs during the S2 --> S3 transition that makes the S3 state much less susceptible to NH2R.The implications of these findings are discussed with special emphasis on the possibility of complexed peroxide formation in redox state S3 postulated previously on the basis of theoretical considerations <Renger,

beneficial effects of PG in reducing the amounts of runoff and sediment yield depended on the soil dispersivity.In a highly dispersive soil the positive effect was apparent at the lower rates of application (< 5 Mg ha-1) and gradually leveled off at the higher application rates.Conversely, on a soil with low dispersivity the beneficial effect of PG was obtained only at the higher rates of application (> 5 Mg ha-1).Differences in response to the PG application were explained in terms of the complementary effects of PG on chemical dispersion and mulching.The effects of PG decreased in subsequent storms indicating a progressive removal of PG from the soil surface by runoff and downward percolation.The orthophosphate-P concentrations in the runoff were generally much greater than 0.025 mg L-1, which is considered as the threshold concentration limiting algae proliferation in surface waters.Phosphorus removal by runoff and erosion gradually decreased in subsequent storms.The

experimentally demonstrates a new technique for hole diffusion length measurement in n-type semiconductors.The technique utilizes the photoelectrochemical etching process of n-type semiconductors, because a very low interface recombination velocity at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface is expected, and furthermore a photoelectrochemical etching profile of n-type semiconductors with a relatively large bandgap such as GaAs is precisely reflected by photogenerated hole concentration profile at the sample surface.For a sample surface with a selectively damaged region where hole lifetime is markedly reduced, an etching profile is theoretically calculated from a photogenerated hole concentration profile at the surface.The theoretical analysis shows that hole diffusion length in the undamaged region can be estimated from the etching profile near the boundary between damaged and undamaged regions.It is also shown that a bulk hole diffusion length can be measured without influences of the interface recombination velocity when the interface recombination velocity at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface is less than about 10(5) cm/s.This technique is successfully applied to the hole diffusion length measurement in n-type InP and GaAs bulk crystals.Hole diffusion length data larger than those previously reported are obtained for these samples.This indicates a

four months of galactose intoxication, dose-dependent changes in the size distribution of myelinated nerve fibers were apparent.A shift in size-frequency histograms of galactose-intoxicated animals towards smaller fibers was accompanied by a decrease in axon diameter and the volume fraction ratio of axon to myelinated nerve fibers.In the sciatic nerve of all 40% galactose-fed rats examined by electron microscopy, Schwann cells of myelinated fibers showed both reactive and degenerative changes.Demyelination was preceded by splitting at the intraperiod line.Remyelination was identified by axons with disproportionately thin myelin sheaths.Axonal dystrophy and degeneration were infrequently seen, but there was axonal regeneration.Dose-dependent increases in mast cell  number were observed with degranulation apparent in rats receiving 20% and 40% galactose.Endothelial cell number and basal lamina thickness were increased in the endoneurial vessels of galactose-intoxicated rats.Increased cytoplasmic area and degenerative changes in pericytes were also noted.These observations indicate that significant  morphologic changes accompany the hyperosmotic imbalance resulting from galactose intoxication of four months duration.Schwann cell injury and demyelination are present in a disorder linked to polyol metabolism since aldose reductase, the anabolic enzyme of the polyol pathway, is localized to this myelin-forming cell."}, {"x": 283, "text": "The defined substrate technology (DST) method is a reagent system designed to enumerate specific target microbes(s)

for the highly damped oxygen-yield oscillations (Delrieu, M.J.and Rosengard, F.(1988) Biochim.Biophys.Acta, 936, 39-49).In this paper, further investigation of the fluorescence yield patterns shows that in the oxygen-evolving centers responsible for the period 4 fluorescence oscillations (and only in these centers), a change in the S0 and S1 properties develops during dark adaptation, affecting the S state advancement only on the first flash of a series.The miss factor (around 1-4%) was greatly increased on the first flash of a series for the S0 --> S1 and S1 --> S2 transitions (1) when the relatively high flash energy was decreased, (2) during the (short) dark period that followed one or three pre-flashes, (3) after partial Cl- or Ca2+ depletion.There are two possible explanations of the misses on the first flash only:  (a) either after the first flash no reaction occurs in a percentage of S0 and S1 state centers and the miss factors are therefore alpha-0 and alpha-1, or (b) a reaction occurs after the first flash, and the reaction results in the formation of inactive S0, S1 and S2 state centers (the miss factors are then alpha-0, alpha-1 and alpha-2).The centers studied

effect.This was found for total doses of 100, approximately 50 and approximately 26-mu-g DMBA.Similarly, increasing the size of the dose increased the effect on the tumor and carcinoma crop, but to a less pronounced event than splitting the dose into several fractions.The most striking of these effects was that a single dose of 51.2-mu-g DMBA gave a tumor rate of approximately 40%, whereas the same dose divided into 50 doses of 1-mu-g gave a tumor rate of almost 100%.The final tumor yield increased from approximately 45 tumors per 32 animals after a single dose of 51.2-mu-g DMBA to approximately 250 tumors per 32 animals after 50 applications of 1-mu-g DMBA.The final number of carcinomas per 32 animals was one carcinoma after a single application of 51.2-mu-g DMBA, and 40

plausible and prudent to infer that the dose schedule that represents the highest tumorigenic hazard for mouse skin may generally also be the dose schedule that involves the highest risk for

onto the island.Paleoshorelines were at least 65 m and probably as high as 90 m above present-day sea level.With 75 m shoreline elevation, the average water-depth values correspond to iceberg calving rates of 650 to 2100 m/yr.The total ice-volume flux minus the iceberg-calving flux is equal to the rate of change in terminus position times the terminus area.Because the terminus is stationary when moraines are deposited, the calving flux is equal to the discharge flux at that time.Calculated discharge fluxes for Mount Desert Island range from 0.65 to 2.9 x 10(5) m3/yr; the average is 1.7 x

sensitivity and the redox environment of the grains are closely correlated.The model considers environmental influences on grain defects, termed oxidized states.The amplified detector quantum sensitivity is derived to be inversely proportional to the number of oxidized states in the grains.Oxidized states are therefore concluded to be the main detector loss channel and sensitization is

initial gamma-FeOOH samples with different particle sizes.The transition temperature of gamma-FeOOH to gamma-Fe2O3 and the size of the resulting particles were not affected by the particle size of the parent lepidocrocite.In contrast, the gamma-Fe2O3 to alpha-Fe2O3 transition temperature seems to depend on the amount of excess water molecules present in the parent lepidocrocite.Thirteen products obtained by heating for one hour at selected temperatures, were considered.Powder X-ray diffraction was used to qualify their composition and to determine their mean crystallite diameters.Transmission electron micrographs revealed the particle morphology.The Mossbauer spectra at 80 K and room temperature of the mixed and pure decomposition products generally had to be analyzed with a distribution of hyperfine fields and, where appropriate, with an additional quadrupole-splitting distribution.The Mossbauer spectra at variable temperature between 4.2 and 400 K of two single-phase gamma-Fe2O3 samples with extremely small particles show the effect of superparamagnetism over a very broad temperature range.Only at the lowest temperatures (T less-than-or-equal-to 55 K), two distributed components were resolved from the magnetically split spectra.In the external-field spectra the DELTA-m(I) = 0 transitions have not vanished.This effect is an intrinsic property of the maghemite particles, indicating a strong spin canting with respect to the applied-field direction.The spectra are successfully reproduced using a bidimensional-distribution approach in which both the canting angle and the magnetic hyperfine field vary within certain intervals.The observed distributions are ascribed to the defect structure of the maghemites (unordered vacancy distribution on B-sites, large surface-to-bulk ratio, presence of OH- groups).An important new finding is the correlation between the magnitude of the hyperfine field and the average canting angle for A-site ferric ions, whereas the B-site spins show a more uniform canting.The Mossbauer parameters of the two hematite samples with MCD104 values of respectively 61.0 and 26.5 nm display a temperature variation which is very similar to that of small-particle hematites obtained from thermal decomposition of goethite.However, for a given MCD the Morin transition temperature for the latter samples is about 30 K lower.This

Morin transition to lower temperatures."}, {"x": 472, "text": "Liposomes have been studied by means of high-field magnetic resonance techniques.The choline N+(CH3)3 group showed two proton resonances

flashes (2-mu-s duration; 100-ms intervals) were used instead of continuous light, this transient was almost suppressed indicating that it was dependent on the saturation of some component of the chloroplastic chain.The second transient (inhibition of O2 uptake) was present when spaced flashes were used instead of continuous light.It was markedly decreased by addition of CCCP and mitochondrial inhibitors (antimycin A, oligomycin, KCN) which strongly indicates that it relied on mitochondrial respiration.It is concluded from these experiments that illumination of the cells resulted in an

provided by seven mu-AcO- and two chelating pic- groups; the overall structure has idealized C2 symmetry.The anion of 1 bears striking similarity to the cation <Mn4O2(O2CMe)7(bpy)2>+ reported previously, showing little structural consequence of the pic-for-bpy substitution.Treatment of <Mn3O(O2CR)6(py)3>(ClO4) (R = Me, Et) with Na(pic).3/4H2O in MeCN leads to formation of sparingly soluble Na<Mn4O2(O2CR)7(pic)2> salts, providing an additional synthetic route to the tetranuclear anions.Complex 1 can be cleanly converted to 2 by treatment with excess PhCOOH in MeCN, demonstrating facile carboxylate exchange with more acidic acids.Variable-temperature, solid-state magnetic susceptibility studies have been performed on complex 1 in the range 5-300 K.The effective magnetic moment, mu-eff/Mn4, decreases gradually from 7.98 mu-B at 300.0 K to 6.35 mu-B at 25.00 K and then decreases more rapidly to 3.28 mu-B at 5.00 K.The data were fit to a theoretical expression derived from the appropriate spin Hamiltonian for a Mn4O2 core with C2v symmetry which also included an axial zero-field splitting term <D(S triple-over-dot-z2 - 1/3S triple-over-dot-T2)> for the S = 3 ground state.The fitting parameters are J(wb) = -5.3 cm-1, J(bb) = -24.6 cm-1, g = 1.96, and D = 3.7 cm-1 with TIP held constant at 200 x 10(-6) cgsu; J(bb) refers to the interaction between the two-body

lower vertebrates in which urea plays a physiological role are considered to see whether they might provide insight into the origin of ureosmotic regulation.The guppy shows high urea synthesis and retention during embryonic development, and it is possible that a developmental role of urea is a general phenomenon in fishes.The toadfish, thought to be an enigma with high urea synthesis in the absence of an obvious physiological role of urea, is ureotelic under some conditions.Its urea excretion is likely related to renal function and/or parental care.In lungfish high ureogenesis is associated with estivation in periodically dry habitats.The resultant hyperuremia prevents ammonia toxicity, inhibits water loss and may repress metabolism.Latimeria is a classic marine ureosmotic regulator in which urea is used as an osmolyte that allows osmotic equilibrium with sea water while maintaining low ion levels.Adults of the frog, Rana cancrivora, are also ureosmotic regulators in brackish water.A scenario is proposed that suggests how ureosmotic regulation could have evolved in Latimeria and other fishes.The ornithine-urea cycle (composed of an arginine synthetic pathway and a second pathway that splits arginine into urea) occurred in fossil anadromous agnathans.Here the first pathway functioned in the ammocoete-like larvae for the generation of arginine to supplement a protein-deficient diet of algae, whereas the arginase pathway was important in the embryo for vitellin catabolism.Gnathostome evolution was associated with trends towards large eggs and prolonged development, requiring a complete ornithine-urea cycle for ammonia detoxification in embryos.Retention of a complete ornithine-urea cycle throughout adult life (via paedomorphosis) would preadapt any relatively large, sluggish, euryhaline fish for ureosmotic regulation when it was exposed to sea water.It is suggested that ureosmotic regulators evolved from freshwater or anadromous ancestors that entered the marine habitat.Once early ureosmotic regulators were established in the sea there would have been strong selection for internal fertilization and development, as is seen in Latimeria and many elasmobranchs.It is suggested that ureosmotic regulation was a common strategy in Paleozoic marine gnathostomes.", "rank": 140, "paragraph_comparative_number": 9, "entities": [], "id": "p_140"},

reflections with F > 2.33-sigma(F).The complex is mixed-valence (Mn(II), Mn(III)), and the structure consists of two Mn atoms bridged by two oxygen atoms from two biphen groups, the other oxygen atoms of which are terminally ligated to the Mn(III) center.Six-coordination of the latter is completed by a chelating bpy.The Mn(II) has a chelating bpy, and five-coordination is completed by a monodentate biphenH, the second oxygen of which is protonated as in 2.The Mn(II) and Mn(III) coordination geometries are distorted square-pyramidal and octahedral, respectively.The structure of complex 5 is assumed to be a six-coordinate, distorted octahedral monomer.Variable-temperature solid-state magnetic susceptibility studies on complex 4 at 10.0 kG are reported; the effective magnetic moment, mu-eff/Mn2, steadily increases from 7.12-mu-B at 302.4 K to a maximum of 8.31-mu-B at 8.00 K, and then decreases slightly to 8.24-mu-B at 5.00 K, consistent with an intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange interaction.Complex 4 is the first Mn(II)Mn(III) complex to exhibit a ferromagnetic interaction.In order to characterize fully the ferromagnetic coupling in this complex, magnetic susceptibility data were collected in the low-temperature range (approximately 2-15 K) at fields of 10.0, 24.5, 34.1, and 43.5 kG.All data, including that at high temperatures, were least-squares fit

acid deposited on glass slides were compared with the spectra obtained for homogeneous solutions of these dyes and for these dyes adsorbed on substrates.In spite of a similar electronic structure the

appropriate, with an additional quadrupole-splitting distribution.The Mossbauer spectra at variable temperature between 4.2 and 400 K of two single-phase gamma-Fe2O3 samples with extremely small
