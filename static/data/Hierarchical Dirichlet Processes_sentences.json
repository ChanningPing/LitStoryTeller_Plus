franchise representation of this model as discussed in Section 5, it turns out that the result is equivalent to the coupled urn model of Beal et al.", "548": "(2002), hence the infinite hidden Markov model is an HDP-HMM.", "549": "Unfortunately, posterior inference using the Chinese restaurant franchise representation is awkward for this model, involving substantial bookkeeping.", "550": "Indeed, Beal et al.", "551": "(2002) did not present an MCMC inference algorithm for the infinite hidden Markov model, proposing instead a heuristic approximation to Gibbs sampling.", "552": "On the other hand, both the augmented representation and direct assignment representations lead directly to MCMC sampling schemes that are straightforward to implement.", "553": "In the experiments reported in the following section we used the direct assignment representation.", "554": "Practical applications of hidden Markov models often consider sets of sequences, and treat these sequences as exchangeable at the level of sequences.", "555": "Thus, in applications to speech recognition, a hidden Markov model for a given word in the vocabulary is generally trained via replicates of that word being spoken.", "556": "This setup is readily accommodated within the hierarchical DP framework by simply considering an additional level of the Bayesian hierarchy, letting a master Dirichlet process couple each of the HDP-HMMs, each of which is a set of Dirichlet processes.", "557": "7.1 Alice inWonderland", "558": "In this section we report experimental results for the problem of predicting strings of letters in sentences taken from Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures in Wonderland, comparing the HDP-HMM to other HMM-related approaches.", "559": "Each sentence is treated as a sequence of letters and spaces (rather than as a sequence of words).", "560": "There are 27 distinct symbols (26 letters and space); cases and punctuation marks are ignored.", "561": "There are 20 training sentences with average length of 51 symbols, and there are 40 test sentences with an average length of 100.", "562": "The base distribution H is a symmetric Dirichlet distribution over 27 symbols with parameters 0.1.", "563": "The concentration parameters   and \u000b0 are given Gamma(1, 1) priors.", "564": "Using the direct assignment sampling method for posterior predictive inference, we compared the HDD-HMM to a variety of other methods for prediction using hidden Markov models: (1) a classical HMM using maximum likelihood (ML) parameters obtained via the Baum-Welch algorithm (Rabiner 1989), (2) a classical HMM using maximum a posteriori (MAP) parameters, taking the priors to be independent, symmetric Dirichlet distributions for both the transition and emission probabilities, and (3) a classical HMMtrained using an approximation to a full Bayesian analysis in particular, a variational Bayesian (VB) method due to MacKay (1997) and described in detail in Beal (2003).", "565": "For each of these classical HMMs, we conducted experiments for each value of the state cardinality ranging from 1 to 60.", "566": "We present the perplexity on test sentences in Figure 7 (Left).", "567": "For VB, the predictive probability is intractable to compute, so the modal setting of parameters was used.", "568": "Both MAP and VB models were given optimal settings of the hyperparameters found using the

the HDP-HMM.", "571": "8 DISCUSSION", "572": "We have described a nonparametric approach to the modeling of groups of data, where each group is characterized by a mixture model and we allow mixture components to be shared between groups.", "573": "We have proposed a hierarchical Bayesian solution to this problem, in which a set of Dirichlet processes are coupled via their base measure, which is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process.", "574": "We have described three different representations that capture aspects of the hierarchical Dirichlet process.", "575": "In particular, we described a stick-breaking representation that describes the random measures explicitly, a representation of marginals in terms of an urn model that we referred to as the Chinese restaurant franchise, and a representation of the process in terms of an infinite limit of finite mixture models.", "576": "These representations led to the formulation of three Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes for posterior inference under hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures.", "577": "The first scheme is based directly on the Chinese restaurant franchise representation, the second scheme represents the posterior using both a Chinese restaurant franchise and a sample from the global measure, while the third uses a direct assignment of data items to mixture components.", "578": "Clustering is an important activity in many large-scale data analysis problems in engineering and science, reflecting the heterogeneity that is often present when data are collected on a large scale.", "579": "Clustering problems can be approached within a probabilistic framework via finite mixture models (Fraley and Raftery 2002; Green and Richardson 2001), and recent years have seen numerous examples of applications of finite mixtures and their dynamical cousins the HMM in areas such as bioinformatics (Durbin et al.", "580": "1998), speech recognition (Huang et al.", "581": "2001), information retrieval (Blei et al.", "582": "2003) and computational vision (Forsyth and Ponce 2002).", "583": "These areas also provide numerous instances of data analyses which involve multiple, linked sets of clustering problems, for which classical clustering methods (model-based or non-model-based) provide little in the way of leverage.", "584": "In bioinformatics we have already alluded to the problem of finding haplotype structure in subpopulations.", "585": "Other examples in bioinformatics include the use of HMMs for amino acid sequences, where a hierarchical DP version of the HMM would allow motifs to be discovered and shared among different families of proteins.", "586": "In speech recognition multiple HMMs are already widely used, in the form of word-specific and speaker-specific models, and adhoc methods are generally used to share statistical strength among models.", "587": "We have discussed examples of grouped data in information retrieval; other examples include problems in which groups are indexed by author or by language.", "588": "Finally, computational vision and robotics problems often involve sets of descriptors or objects that are arranged in a taxonomy.", "589": "Examples such as these, in which there is substantial uncertainty regarding appropriate numbers of clusters, and in which the sharing of statistical strength among groups is natural and desirable, suggest that the hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian approach to clustering presented here may provide a generally useful extension of model-based clustering."}, "scenes":
